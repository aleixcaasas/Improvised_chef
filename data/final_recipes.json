Melt in the microwave on medium for about 11⁄2 minutes (or over a pan of simmering water).Stir the chocolate until melted, then tip in the sugar, butter, peanut butter, egg and vanilla and beat with a wooden spoon until well mixed. Stir in the flour, all the milk chocolate chunks, the nuts (no need to chop) and half the plain chocolate chunks. The mixture will feel quite soft, and drop easily from the spoon if you shake it.Drop big spoonfuls in 12 piles on to 2 or 3 baking sheets, leaving room for them to spread (you may need to bake in batches). Stick the remaining chunks into the cookies (2-3 pieces in each).Bake for 10-12 minutes until they are tinged very slightly darker around the edges. The smell will let you know they are ready. They will be soft in the middle, but will crisp up as they cool. (Cook for longer and you’ll have crisper cookies.) Let them cool and firm up for a few minutes on the baking sheet (they’ll break if you move them while still hot), then lift off with a wide spatula on to a cooling rack. They will keep crisp in an airtight tin for 3-4 days.Use your gift card to cook our incredible Antipasti Pasta recipe!",

Tip the flour, cheese and a pinch of salt into a large bowl and mix. Add the butter and rub it in using your fingertips until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Mix in 4-5 tbsp cold water, and bring together into a dough. Wrap and chill for 30 mins.To make the filling, melt the butter in a medium saucepan over a medium heat, then add the oil and onions and cook for 10-15 mins until caramelised. Add the thyme and fry for 1 min more. Tip in the flour, and stir to combine. Gradually stir in the stock, adding it in small amounts to prevent lumps forming. Bring to a simmer and cook for 10 mins, stirring occasionally. Stir in the mustard and vinegar towards the end of the cooking time.Meanwhile, put the potatoes in a large pan of cold water, bring to the boil and cook for 4-5 mins until just cooked and still holding their shape. Drain well, then stir into the sauce. Add the apples, cheddar and some seasoning, and stir again. Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6.Pour the filling into a 28cm oval baking dish (ours was 28 x 18.5 x 6.5cm). While it cools, roll out the pastry on a surface lightly dusted with flour to the thickness of a £1 coin. Cut into strips roughly 1cm wide. Lay half the strips across the dish horizontally, leaving gaps of a few millimetres in-between, then, one by one, weave in the remaining strips vertically, using an over and under technique, also spacing them apart by a few millimetres. Re-roll any trimmings and cut into flowers, leaves, or other shapes to decorate, if you like (see tip, below). Arrange any pastry shapes on top, then brush with the beaten egg.Bake for 50 mins, keeping an eye on it – you may need to cover the top with foil if it’s starting to brown too quickly. Leave to cool for at least 10 mins before serving.RECIPE TIPSIf you have any small biscuit or fondant cutters, you can use these to cut out pastry shapes to decorate the top of the pie. Simply dust the cutters with flour to stop the pastry from sticking, then stamp out whatever shapes you choose. You can even use the smaller end of piping nozzles to create mini rounds, or cups and glasses for bigger discs.If you want to create a lattice top but you’re new to pastry, go for a rustic effect. Simply cut the strips of pastry in different sizes and weave them in and out – the varying sizes means any pastry mishaps will go unnoticed.Use your gift card to cook our incredible Antipasti Pasta recipe!",

It's a great make-ahead braise to feed family and friendsA day or two ahead, cut the meat into large 5cm chunks. Put in a glass bowl with the garlic, star anise, thyme, bay and plenty of seasoning. Mix everything together well.Pour the wine into a large saucepan (keep the lid to hand and turn off any extractor fans). Bring to a boil, then, at arms-length, ignite with a long match. Wait for the flames to burn off (there will be quite a few), then boil for 5 mins more. If you don't feel comfortable setting the flames alight, just boil the wine. Pour the wine over the meat, then cover and cool slightly before chilling overnight or for up to 36 hrs.Lift the beef out of the marinade and dry on kitchen paper. Heat half the oil in a large casserole. Working in batches, brown the beef for 10 mins, adding more oil if needed (watch out – this will splutter). Once browned, transfer the beef chunks to a plate.Heat oven to 150C/130C fan/gas 3. Add a touch more oil to the dish, then tip in the veg and gently brown for 10 mins. Use a wooden spatula to scrape any sticky bits off the bottom. Scatter over the flour and cook for 2 mins, then stir in the tomato purée. Add the meat and any juices from the plate back in, then pour over the marinade with all the aromatics. Bring everything to a simmer and give it a good stir, then cover and place in the oven for 3½-4 hrs, stirring every hour or so until the meat is very tender. You now have a delicious rustic stew that can be served as is, but keep going to take it to the next level.Leave the stew to cool, then carefully tip into a sieve or colander set over a bowl. Lift the meat and carrots back into the casserole, then squish everything else in the sieve so that you extract the juices and some of the garlic gets squished through. Simmer this sauce in a pan for 10 mins or until thickened to your liking, then pour over the meat.While the meat is braising, heat the rest of the oil in a frying pan. Fry the bacon and onions for 15 mins until the bacon is crisp and the onions have softened and browned. Turn the heat up, add the mushrooms and fry until cooked. Tip the contents of the frying pan into the casserole, stir and simmer for a few mins. Scatter over the parsley, then bring the dish to the table and serve with the carb of your choice.By boiling down the sauce, you get to specify the consistency and flavour, leaving nothing to chance. Scooping off any froth that forms gives you a finer sauceYou can make this up to three days ahead, then chill and reheat. The longer you leave it, the more full-bodied the flavour.

        "description": "A foolproof brownie recipe for a squidgy chocolate bake. Watch our recipe video to help you get a perfect traybake every time.Cut 185g unsalted butter into small cubes and tip into a medium bowl. Break 185g dark chocolate into small pieces and drop into the bowl.Fill a small saucepan about a quarter full with hot water, then sit the bowl on top so it rests on the rim of the pan, not touching the water. Put over a low heat until the butter and chocolate have melted, stirring occasionally to mix them.Remove the bowl from the pan. Alternatively, cover the bowl loosely with cling film and put in the microwave for 2 minutes on High. Leave the melted mixture to cool to room temperature.While you wait for the chocolate to cool, position a shelf in the middle of your oven and turn the oven on to 180C/160C fan/gas 4.Using a shallow 20cm square tin, cut out a square of kitchen foil (or non-stick baking parchment) to line the base. Tip 85g plain flour and 40g cocoa powder into a sieve held over a medium bowl. Tap and shake the sieve so they run through together and you get rid of any lumps.Chop 50g white chocolate and 50g milk chocolate into chunks on a board.Break 3 large eggs into a large bowl and tip in 275g golden caster sugar. With an electric mixer on maximum speed, whisk the eggs and sugar. They will look thick and creamy, like a milk shake. This can take 3-8 minutes, depending on how powerful your mixer is. You’ll know it’s ready when the mixture becomes really pale and about double its original volume. Another check is to turn off the mixer, lift out the beaters and wiggle them from side to side. If the mixture that runs off the beaters leaves a trail on the surface of the mixture in the bowl for a second or two, you’re there.Pour the cooled chocolate mixture over the eggy mousse, then gently fold together with a rubber spatula. Plunge the spatula in at one side, take it underneath and bring it up the opposite side and in again at the middle. Continue going under and over in a figure of eight, moving the bowl round after each folding so you can get at it from all sides, until the two mixtures are one and the colour is a mottled dark brown. The idea is to marry them without knocking out the air, so be as gentle and slow as you like.Hold the sieve over the bowl of eggy chocolate mixture and resift the cocoa and flour mixture, shaking the sieve from side to side, to cover the top evenly.Gently fold in this powder using the same figure of eight action as before. The mixture will look dry and dusty at first, and a bit unpromising, but if you keep going very gently and patiently, it will end up looking gungy and fudgy. Stop just before you feel you should, as you don’t want to overdo this mixing.Finally, stir in the white and milk chocolate chunks until they’re dotted throughout.Pour the mixture into the prepared tin, scraping every bit out of the bowl with the spatula. Gently ease the mixture into the corners of the tin and paddle the spatula from side to side across the top to level it.Put in the oven and set your timer for 25 mins. When the buzzer goes, open the oven, pull the shelf out a bit and gently shake the tin. If the brownie wobbles in the middle, it’s not quite done, so slide it back in and bake for another 5 minutes until the top has a shiny, papery crust and the sides are just beginning to come away from the tin. Take out of the oven.Leave the whole thing in the tin until completely cold, then, if you’re using the brownie tin, lift up the protruding rim slightly and slide the uncut brownie out on its base. If you’re using a normal tin, lift out the brownie with the foil (or parchment). Cut into quarters, then cut each quarter into four squares and finally into triangles.They’ll keep in an airtight container for a good two weeks and in the freezer for up to a month.Try our lower fat option, Ultimate makeover: Chocolate brownies, or other popular brownie recipes, Fudgy coconut brownies or Marbled brownies.Try these next-level, indulgent brownies from our sister title olivemagazine.com/brownies.Use your gift card to cook our incredible Antipasti Pasta recipe!",

Roll out on a lightly floured work surface until it is the thickness of a £1 coin and use to line a 22-23cm loose-bottomed tart tin. Chill for 30 mins.Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Scrunch up a sheet of baking parchment, then flatten it out and press gently over the pastry. Pile in baking beans and blind-bake for 15-20 mins until the pastry is biscuity. Remove the parchment and beans and bake for 5 mins more until cooked through. Brush with egg white and return to the oven for 2 mins; this will help to keep the base crisp. Reduce oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and spread the jam over the base of the tart.Melt the chocolate and butter in a microwave, in short bursts on High, stirring in between, or in a bowl over – but not touching – a pan of barely simmering water. Whisk the eggs, egg yolk and sugar with an electric whisk for a full 10 mins until pale and thick. Take your time when beating the eggs and sugar - they should be mousse-like. Sieve the flour and remaining cocoa and fold in, together with the melted chocolate, using a big metal spoon.Scrape into the tin and scatter over the cherries. Bake for 20-25 mins until the filling has slightly puffed but is still slightly wobbly when you shake it. Chill for 3 hrs or overnight, then sprinkle with a few cherries and a dusting of icing sugar. Serve with crème fraîche.If you haven’t got baking beans for blind-baking, use uncooked rice or dried beans instead. If you don’t have a cherry pitter, you can remove the stones with a metal piping nozzle. Simply place the nozzle on a flat surface, tip facing upwards, and firmly press the cherry onto the nozzle until the stone comes out of the top. If you haven’t got baking beans for blind-baking, use uncooked rice or dried beans instead. If you don’t have a cherry pitter, you can remove the stones with a metal piping nozzle.

        "description": "Master the art of making a blackberry pie with our ultimate recipe – we’ve got a few tricks up our sleeve to right some common wrongsFirst, make the pastry. Tip both flours and the sugar into a bowl with a large pinch of salt. Use your fingers to rub the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles crumble topping, then rub in the soft cheese until the pastry comes together. (If it’s still crumbly, add 1 tbsp iced water and it should come together.) Tip onto a surface and knead for 30 seconds, then cut off about a third of the pastry. Mould both pieces into flat rounds. Wrap and chill for at least 1 hr. Will keep chilled for up to two days.Wash and drain the blackberries, being careful not to break them up, then tip into a bowl with the sugar. (If they are wild blackberries, they will need slightly more sugar.) Toss together and set aside while you roll out the pastry.Butter a 23cm pie dish and, on a lightly floured surface, roll the larger piece of pastry out into a round that fits the base of the dish with some overhanging. Push the pastry down in and around the dish to line it. Sprinkle the cornflour over the blackberries and gently mix together. Tip the blackberries and all their sugary juices into the pastry case and dot with the butter. Beat together the egg and milk to make a glaze, then brush the edge of the pie with some of it.For an easy pie, simply roll out the rest of the pastry, drape it over the top, then trim and fork or crimp the edges together. For a lattice finish, roll the remaining pastry into a square, roughly 30 x 30cm. Cut out 10 strips of roughly the same width. Lay five of the strips vertically over the pie, then weave with the remaining five horizontally, to create an even lattice over the fruit. Or, if you prefer, you can cut each strip into three thinner strips to weave a more delicate lattice. Pinch the edges, then trim the excess and crimp. Can be assembled and chilled four hours before baking, or baked straightaway.Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6 with a baking tray inside. Brush the top of the pie with more egg glaze and bake for 20 mins, then brush with the glaze again, scatter generously with extra sugar and bake for another 20-25 mins until the pastry is a deep golden colour and the juices are bubbling. Leave the pie to cool for at least 30 mins, then serve as is, or with ice cream.Use your gift card to cook our incredible Antipasti Pasta recipe!",

We love this sweet treat spread on freshly baked breadIf you don’t have a cooking thermometer, put a saucer in the freezer. Sterilise the jars you want to use. Tip the blackcurrants into a heavy-based saucepan with about 100ml of water. Bring to the boil and simmer for 5 mins until the fruit has broken down to a chunky pulp. Leave to cool slightly.You now have two options. For a smooth jelly-style jam, squash the fruit through a sieve into a bowl. If you prefer your jam chunky and seeded, leave the pulp as it is. Whether it's strained or unstrained, weigh the fruit pulp and then add 400g of sugar to every 500g of pulp, then tip back in the saucepan.Pour in the lemon juice then heat gently, stirring, to dissolve the sugar. Turn up the heat, then boil hard for about 10 mins or until it reaches 105C (setting point) on a cooking thermometer. If you don’t own a thermometer, test for setting point by spooning a little jam onto the cold saucer. After a couple of minutes gently push your finger through the jam – if the surface wrinkles, it's ready. If not, return to the boil for 2 mins, then re-test.Take off the heat and skim off any froth with a slotted spoon. Cool for 10-15 minutes. Stir gently to distribute the fruit, then ladle into sterilised jars. Keeps for 6 months in a cool dry cupboard.Blackcurrants have enough pectin (the thing that makes jam set) in them that you should be fine with normal sugar. The usual sugar to fruit ratio for jam is 50/50, but this makes for a very sweet finished product – to let the flavour of the fruit come through more, we’ve taken the sugar down a bit. This recipe is for a small batch of jam, but it's easily increased for a bigger batch.

It's delicious on its own or served with a hunk of crusty, buttered breadHeat the oil in a casserole pot over a low heat. Add the onion, celery and carrot, along with a generous pinch of salt, and fry gently for 15 mins, or until the veg begins to soften. If you're using pancetta, add it to the pan, turn up the heat and fry for a few mins more until turning golden brown. Tip in the cabbage and fry for 5 mins, then stir through the garlic, paprika and rosemary and cook for 1 min more.Tip the chopped tomatoes and stock into the pan. Bring to a simmer, then cook, uncovered, for 30 mins, adding the chickpeas for the final 10 mins. Season generously with salt and black pepper.Ladle the soup into six deep bowls. Serve with the shaved parmesan and crusty bread, if you like.The cabbage soup diet is a short-term weight loss method. A lean portion of cabbage soup is mixed with other meals of fruit, vegetables and protein. Due to the very low-calorie nature of this diet, followers have reported up to 4.5kg weight loss in one week, however nutritionists warn that the loss is mainly fluids and as such is likely to return quickly when a normal diet is resumed. Due to the restrictive nature of this diet, it is not sustainable in the long-term, nor is it meant to be. It may cause people to become light-headed and/or dizzy due to the very low-calorie level. As cabbage is part of the brassica family, some people may also experience mild digestive discomfort such as bloating and flatulence if they are sensitive to this family of vegetables.For a full breakdown of how this diet works, read our cabbage soup diet guide written by Dietician Emer Delaney BSc (Hons), RD.who has advised against using it as a sustainable eating plan and warns that it should never be followed for a period longer than seven days.Freezing dishes with a low fat content doesn’t work very well as ice crystals form and destroy the texture of the other ingredients. This is a soup that is better made fresh. If you do want to freeze ahead, then do as advised above and make the soup without the cabbage and freeze that. Defrost in a pan over a low heat and stir in the wilted cabbage before you are ready to eat it. Use your gift card to cook our incredible Antipasti Pasta recipe!",

        "description": "Pulse cauliflower in a food processor to make cauliflower couscous or an easy rice-like side dish that's much lower GI and ready in just 10 minutesCut the hard core and stalks from the cauliflower and pulse the rest in a food processor to make grains the size of rice. Tip into a heatproof bowl, cover with cling film, then pierce and microwave for 7 mins on high – there is no need to add any water. Stir in the coriander. For spicier rice, add some toasted cumin seeds.Cauliflower rice is finely chopped (either by hand or pulsed in a food processor) raw cauliflower that's small enough to look like grains of rice. It’s used as a low-carb substitute for grains like couscous or rice. It’s often eaten as a side dish with some dressing or herbs for flavour. It can be eaten raw or cooked very quickly to warm through, although it only needs minimal cooking or will become too soft.Cauliflower rice is best eaten within a day or two of making, and it doesn’t freeze well as it can become watery when thawed. You could make the cauliflower ‘grains’ a few days ahead and store in an airtight container in the fridge if you wanted to get ahead.Heat a little oil in a frying pan and add any spices or flavourings you like, such as ground cumin, smoked paprika, chilli or fennel seeds. When hot, add the cauliflower rice and stir-fry for 3-4 mins until tender and heated through. You can also tip into a bowl, cover with a microwave lid or plate, and microwave on high for 2-3 mins to ‘steam’ the rice. A great way to concentrate the nutty flavour of the cauliflower is to tip onto a baking tray, drizzle with oil and roast for 10-12 mins to dry out the rice, and lightly toast as it heats through.For a step-by-step demonstration, watch our video for how to cook cauliflower rice.Serve as a side dish for curries and tagines, substitute as the base for grain bowls, sushi bowls, or the rice in burritos. Cauliflower rice is great raw in tabbouleh and salads, as it absorbs lots of the flavours and dressing. Try adding to a tabouleh with lots of parsley, almonds, tomatoes, and drizzle with a pomegranate molasses dressing.You could also use as the rice in sushi wraps, make a grain-free stir-fry with lots of crunchy veg and soy sauce, or fold in curry powder, smoked mackerel and poached eggs for a lighter kedgeree.A food processor makes light work of making cauliflower rice, but you can also cut the florets by hand to create a more ‘chunky’ rice, or use the coarse side of a box grater to grate the cauliflower into small pieces, instead.The key to preventing soggy cauliflower rice is making sure you don’t overcook it. Once the ‘grains’ are hot, you’re ready to serve. The best cooking method to avoid any sogginess is to roast the cauliflower grains on a wide, shallow tray. This means there’s more evaporation and less water in the cooked grains.If you’re cooking your ‘grains’ in the microwave, this can cause them to steam-cook leaving them a little wetter than if roasting or fried. You can tip out onto a kitchen-paper lined tray and pat dry before serving, if you prefer. Don’t squeeze the grains as they may become more mushy if you do this.Read more in our guide on how to make cauliflower rice.Use your gift card to cook our incredible Antipasti Pasta recipe!",

Now, using a whisk or spatula, carefully stir in the milk, a little at a time, making sure the sauce stays smooth. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook for a couple of mins until it thickens – it will be very thick. Turn the heat right down and keep cooking for 5 mins, stirring often.Meanwhile, heat the oil in a non-stick frying pan and fry all of the chicken in batches until it starts to colour lightly at the edges. Scoop out each batch of chicken and put it on a plate. Add the onion to the pan if you are using it, and cook over a low heat until soft. Add the chicken and any juices and the onion to the white sauce, fold it in and cook the mixture for a further 15 mins or until the chicken is cooked through. If you're making the base ahead of time, you can leave it to cool at this stage then freeze in an airtight container for up to a month.

When firm, slice each into eight even pieces.Lay a chicken breast on a chopping board and use a sharp knife to make a deep pocket inside the breast.

Dip each breast in the flour, then the egg and finally the breadcrumbs, repeating so each kiev has a double coating (this will make them extra crisp and help to keep the butter inside). Chill for at least 1 hr before cooking, or freeze now – see tips, below.To cook, heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Heat the oil in a large frying pan over a medium-high heat.

        "title": "Chocolate eclairs",
        "description": "These deliciously decadent chocolate eclairs filled with creamy vanilla custard are worth the effort. Make a batch of these classic French pastriesStart by making the custard filling. Heat the milk until almost boiling in a saucepan. Meanwhile, mix together the sugar, egg yolks and vanilla in a bowl, then stir in the flours, a couple of tsp at a time, to a smooth paste.Gradually whisk in the hot milk, pour everything back into the saucepan and cook over a high heat, stirring constantly, for about 5 mins until thick – it will go alarmingly lumpy but don’t worry, just keep stirring it vigorously with a wooden spoon until smoothLay a sheet of cling film directly on the custard surface, then cool and chill until you’re ready to fill the buns.To make the choux buns, heat the oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Sift the flour with the sugar and a pinch of salt into a small bowl. Put the milk and butter into a medium saucepan with 125ml water and gently heat so the butter melts but the liquid doesn’t bubble.Once the butter has completely melted, increase the heat until the liquid comes to a fast rolling boil. Immediately turn off the heat, tip in the sifted flour and beat vigorously with a wooden spoon until you a have a smooth dough that comes away from the sides of the pan. Spread over a large dinner plate to cool to hand temperature.Allow to cool for a few minutes, then gradually add the eggs, mixing well between each addition until the mixture reluctantly drops off the spoon. Don’t add all the egg unless you need to.Cut two large sheets of baking parchment. On each one draw two sets of ‘track’ lines with a 10cm gap – these will be your guidelines so your eclairs will all be roughly the same size. Use the paper to line two large baking sheets – penside down. Spoon your choux mixture into a piping bag with a 1cm star or round wide nozzle, or into a disposable piping bag with a similar-size hole snipped off for piping.

A blend of dark chocolate, sugar and double cream, it’s a heavenly combinationLearn how to make ganache with our simple recipe, then check out our chocolate buttercream recipe.Put the chocolate in a large, heatproof mixing bowl. Pour the cream into a saucepan with the sugar and bring to a simmer over a medium heat, stirring continuously until the sugar is melted. Turn up the heat and bring to the boil, then quickly remove from the heat. Pour over the chocolate and whisk until smooth and glossy.Use straight away or leave to cool until thick enough to spread on a cake. Alternatively, set aside to cool completely, then beat with an electric whisk until light and fluffy, and ready for spreading.Ganache is typically a mixture of melted chocolate and cream used to fill truffles or decorate bakes. The cream is heated to a simmering point and then poured over the chocolate, before the two are whisked together. The ratios of chocolate to cream can be adjusted to give different consistencies, depending on how you wish to use it. Our recipe also includes sugar for a touch of sweetness.This depends on taste preference. There are three main types of ganache: dark chocolate, milk chocolate and white chocolate.For dark chocolate ganache, we recommend using a chocolate with at least 60% cocoa solids for a deep flavour. Milk chocolate and white chocolate ganaches have a creamier consistency and sweeter taste, so there’s no need to add sugar.As mentioned above, ganache is commonly used as a filling for chocolate truffles, but it’s also delicious when spread over cakes and other bakes. Try our chocolate ganache drip cake for a tutorial on how to decorate your cake with a showstopping drip effect.If you simply wish to slather your bake in silky ganache, you can’t go wrong with our ultimate chocolate cake or white chocolate cake.It can also be used as a filling for cake layers, as with our chocolate drizzle and truffle torte. Or try ganache as a tart filling – check out our sea-salted chocolate and pecan tart or chocolate and date tart.Need a simple and speedy dessert?

Add 1 tbsp of the sugar and beat to stiff peaks, then add the rest of the sugar, a spoonful at a time, until the mixture is thick and shiny. Sift over the cocoa and cornflour, then gently fold these in with a spatula until completely combined. Spread the mixture evenly into the prepared tin, then bake for 14-15 mins until just crisp to the touch. Leave to cool completely in the tin.",
            "Meanwhile, make the fillings. For the chocolate filling, tip the chocolate and cream into a heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water and stir until the chocolate has melted and the mixture is shiny and smooth. Remove from the heat and leave to cool to room temperature. For the cream filling, whisk the cream and sugar together to stiff peaks using an electric whisk.",
            "Dust a large sheet of baking parchment with cocoa powder, then carefully flip the meringue onto it. Remove the tin and carefully peel away the parchment. With a short end facing you, score a line across the meringue, 2cm in from the edge. Spread over the chocolate filling followed by the cream, then drizzle with most of the caramel sauce. Sprinkle over the sea salt flakes and drag a palette or cutlery knife through the fillings to gently swirl them. Roll up the roulade into a tight log, starting at the scored end and using the parchment underneath to help you. Lift onto a platter or board. Will keep chilled for up to a day.

        "description": "Bake these fabulous cinnamon twists for an on-the-go breakfast or sweet treat. They take a little effort but are well worth itHeat the milk and butter in a small pan until the butter has melted. Allow to cool slightly – the milk should be warm, not hot. Put the flour in a large mixing bowl with a pinch of salt to one side of the bowl. Add the yeast into the flour on the other side of the bowl, so it’s not touching the salt. Pour in the sugar, then mix it all together. Gradually pour the warm milk into the dry ingredients, mixing with your hands until you have a relatively sticky dough. You may not need all of the milk. Add in the egg and continue to work until combined. Lightly dust a surface with flour and tip out the dough. It will be quite wet – the more you knead it, the easier it will become. Knead for around 10 mins until you have a smooth dough. Put in a lightly floured bowl to prove for 1 hr or until doubled in size. To make the filling, mix the melted butter, sugar and cinnamon together until you get a smooth paste. Set aside.Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface to around a 30 x 40cm rectangle. Spread over the filling using a palette knife until the dough is completely covered. Fold in half widthways and cut into 16-18 strips down the shortest side. Twist both ends of each strip in opposite directions until a spiral shape forms. Holding one end in your hand, wrap the rest of the dough around it and over, pressing the ends into the bottom of the bun so it doesn’t unravel during cooking. Lay on two lined baking trays spaced 5cm apart. Leave to prove for 30-45 mins until risen slightly. Heat the oven to 190C/170C fan/gas 5. Brush the tops of the buns with a little egg and bake for 18-20 mins until golden. Don’t worry if a little cinnamon butter comes out. For the coating, mix together the sugar and cinnamon. Whilst still warm, toss the buns in the sugar and eat straight away.

        "description": "This basic batter recipe for crêpes and pancakes is a versatile foundation for either sweet or savoury fillingsSift the flour with a pinch of salt into a medium-size bowl and make a well in the middle. Mix the milk and 100ml of water together. Break the eggs into the well and start whisking slowly. Add the milk and water in a steady stream, whisking constantly and gradually incorporating the flour as you do so.Whisk until the batter is smooth and all the flour has been incorporated. Set the batter aside to rest for 30 mins, then whisk the melted butter into the batter.Heat the pan over a medium heat. Very lightly grease the pan with melted butter. Using a ladle, pour roughly 2 tbsp of batter into the pan and swirl it around so the bottom of the pan is evenly coated. You want to use just enough batter to make a delicate, lacy pancake. Cook the pancake for about 45 secs on one side until golden and then using a palette knife or fish slice, flip the pancake over and cook the other side for about 30 secs until it freckles.Slide the pancake out of the pan and either serve immediately or stack on a plate with baking parchment in between. Continue until all the batter is used up.Try adding orange or lemon zest, a pinch of cinnamon or even finely chopped herbs to the batter, depending on what you fill the pancakes with.Improve your pancake skills: How to make pancakes video.Improve your pancake skills: How to flip a pancake.Use your gift card to cook our incredible Antipasti Pasta recipe!",

Dredge the dough and your hands with a little more flour, then fold the dough over 2-3 times until it’s a little smoother. Pat into a round about 4cm deep. Take a 5cm cutter (smooth-edged cutters tend to cut more cleanly, giving a better rise) and dip it into some flour. Plunge into the dough, then repeat until you have four scones.

Add the onion, carrots and mushrooms, and fry for 5 mins more. Stir in the plain flour and cook for 2 mins, then add the thyme and bay. Slowly stir in the wine and bring to a simmer, then add the stock, a little at a time, stirring between each addition. Season and cover with a tight-fitting lid. Reduce the heat to low. Cook for 30 mins, then remove the lid and cook for 15 mins more. Spoon a little of the sauce into a small bowl and mix with the cornflour, then stir this back into the coq au vin. Remove the thyme and bay. Leave to cool for 1 hr.To make the pastry, tip the flour, salt and butter into a food processor and pulse to fine crumbs. Add half the beaten egg and 2 tbsp ice-cold water and pulse again until the dough just comes together. Add an extra 1 tbsp water if the pastry feels dry. Tip onto a lightly floured work surface and knead briefly until you have a uniform dough, then wrap and chill for at least 1 hr.Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Cut off a quarter of the pastry and roll it into a long strip on a lightly floured surface. Attach the strip of dough around the lip of a 26cm pie dish using a little of the remaining beaten egg, and use any offcuts to make decorations, if you like (we cut out a crescent and scored it to make a chicken decoration). Roll the remaining pastry out into a 30cm circle, about 5mm thick. Spoon the filling into the dish and use the rolling pin to lift the pastry circle over the dish. Crimp the edges in a decorative pattern to seal, or do this with a fork. At this stage, the pie can be wrapped and frozen for up to three months. Defrost in the fridge overnight, then continue as below. Brush with most of the remaining beaten egg and attach any decorations. Chill for 30 mins, then brush with the rest of the egg. Bake in the centre of the oven for 35-40 mins until the pastry is golden and the filling is piping hot. Leave to rest for 10 mins.Meanwhile, make the mash. Put the potatoes in a large saucepan with a large pinch of salt, cover with cold water and bring to the boil, then reduce to a simmer and cover. Cook for 15-20 mins until the tip of a knife can be easily inserted. Drain and leave to steam-dry for 5 mins, then pass through a potato ricer or sieve, or mash with a potato masher. Fold in the butter, warm milk and chives. Season. Serve the pie with the mash.RECIPE TIPSYou can use leftover roast chicken in this pie in place of the chicken thighs. Simply shred the meat into chunky pieces and incorporate into the sauce in step one.Add a herby twist to the pastry by incorporating 1 tbsp thyme leaves with the dry ingredients before adding the wet, or try adding 30g finely grated parmesan for a cheesy version.Use your gift card to cook our incredible Antipasti Pasta recipe!",

Mix well. Leave to marinate for a few hours, or overnight (if marinating overnight, cover and chill).Tip the marinated chicken into a medium saucepan and pour over the coconut milk. Stir, bring to a simmer over a low heat and cook for 40 mins until very tender (it should be falling apart).

Roughly shred the chicken into the sauce in the pan, then stir through the chopped spinach, dried mango and raisins to make a loose filling.

Roll the smaller half out onto a floured surface to a circle about 25cm in diameter, then transfer to a baking tray.

Gently score a criss-cross pattern over the top of the pie using a sharp knife, then brush all over with more of the beaten egg.

        "description": "Make our classic meat and potato pie for a comforting dinner. This great-value family favourite freezes beautifully and is a guaranteed crowd-pleaserHeat 1 tbsp olive oil in a large saucepan and fry 1¼kg beef mince until browned – you may need to do this in batches. Set aside as it browns.Put the other 2 tbsp olive oil into the pan, add 2 finely chopped onions, 3 chopped carrots and 3 chopped celery sticks and cook on a gentle heat until soft, about 20 mins.Add 2 finely chopped garlic cloves, 3 tbsp plain flour and 1 tbsp tomato purée, increase the heat and cook for a few mins, then return the beef to the pan.Pour over a large glass of red wine, if using, and boil to reduce it slightly before adding the 850ml beef stock, 4 tbsp Worcestershire sauce, a few thyme sprigs and 2 bay leaves.Bring to a simmer and cook, uncovered, for 45 mins. By this time the gravy should be thick and coating the meat. Check after about 30 mins – if a lot of liquid remains, increase the heat slightly to reduce the gravy a little. Season well, then discard the bay leaves and thyme stalks.Meanwhile, make the mash. In a large saucepan, cover the 1.8kg potatoes which you've peeled and chopped, in salted cold water, bring to the boil and simmer until tender.Drain well, then allow to steam-dry for a few mins. Mash well with the 225ml milk, 25g butter, and three-quarters of the 200g strong cheddar cheese, then season with freshly grated nutmeg and some salt and pepper.Spoon the meat into 2 ovenproof dishes. Pipe or spoon on the mash to cover. Sprinkle on the remaining cheese.If eating straight away, heat oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7 and cook for 25-30 mins, or until the topping is golden.If you want to use a slow cooker, brown your mince in batches then tip into your slow cooker and stir in the vegetables, flour, purée, wine, stock, Worcestershire sauce and herbs with some seasoning. Cover and cook on High for 4-5 hours. Make the mash following the previous steps, and then oven cook in the same way to finish.To get really smooth, creamy mash, use a potato ricer or sieve.To stop the mash sinking into the filling, allow the meat to coolbefore topping with the mashed potato.Freeze in individual ovenproof dishes for an easy meal for one. For a really crisp, golden topping, flash under the grill for a fewmins before serving.Try this next-level, indulgent cottage pie from our sister title olivemagazine.com/cottage-pie.Make sure the pie is completely cold, then cover it well withcling film and freeze. Always freeze the pie on the day that you make it. Defrost in the fridge overnight, then cook as per the recipe. Alternatively, to cook from frozen, heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4, coverwith foil and cook for 1½ hrs.

Fry the bacon for 5 mins, then turn down the heat, add the white wine and simmer to a glaze. Add the double cream and reduce by half. Add the leeks and simmer for 10 mins, then stir in the thyme leaves, cheddar and season.Yes, this dish can be made ahead and chilled for up to three days. To reheat, put the creamed leeks in a saucepan over a medium heat and stir until warmed through.Add a splash of water or cream to loosen the mixture, if needed.While leeks are available year round, they are at their peak from October through April.Can you use the dark green tops of the leeks?It’s best to remove the tops and outer leaves of the vegetable for this recipe. They can be tough to eat and will take longer to become tender. Use the discards in soup or make your own vegetable stock.How to prepare leeksTrim off the base roots and cut away the uppermost part of the leaves. Remove the outer layer (or ‘white’) if it’s tough. Slice the leek in half lengthwise. Place both halves cut-side down on a board, then slice the leek into half-moons.Thorough washing is very important with leeks, as soil and grit often gets trapped between the many layers of leaves. After slicing the leeks in half, place them in a colander or sieve under cold running water. Toss gently and drain before adding to the pan.This recipe could work as a main when served with roast potatoes. Or, serve creamed leeks alongside fish dishes such as poached salmon or fish cakes, or roast meats and steak.This recipe is made extra-indulgent with bacon rashers and cheddar cheese, but there are many other variations you could try:We don’t advise freezing creamed leeks, as they can become soggy in the liquid over time. However, if you wanted to use them up, you could make the creamed leeks into a pie filling by bulking them out with extra veg or chicken before freezing.Replace bacon with a plant-based vegan alternative, or omit altogether. You can use any vegan hard cheese in place of cheddar, and replace the double cream with vegetable stock and vegan crème fraîche.Use your gift card to cook our incredible Antipasti Pasta recipe!",

        "description": "James Martin shares his recipe for this French patisserie classic. It involves some ambitious pastry work, but the end results are worth itPut the flour, salt and sugar in a mixing bowl. Measure 300ml cold water into a jug, add the yeast and stir. Make a well in the flour and pour in the liquid. Mix, then knead on your work surface for 10 mins. Shape into a ball, put in a lightly oiled bowl, cover and chill for at least 2 hrs.Put the butter between 2 sheets of baking parchment. Using a rolling pin, bash and roll it into a rectangle about 20 x 15cm. Leave wrapped in the baking parchment and chill.Transfer the chilled dough to a floured surface and roll into a 40 x 20cm rectangle. Place the unwrapped slab of butter in the centre of the dough, so that it covers the middle third.Fold one side of the dough up and halfway over the butter.Fold the other side of the dough up and over the butter in the same way, so that the two edges of the dough meet in the centre of the butter.Fold the dough in half so that the point where the ends of the dough meet becomes the seam. Wrap in cling film and chill for 30 mins.Repeat the rolling, folding and chilling process (steps 3-6) twice more in exactly the same way – rolling the pastry while it’s still folded – without adding more butter. Wrap and chill overnight.The next day, roll the dough out on a floured surface into a large rectangle, measuring about 60 x 30cm. Using a sharp knife or pizza cutter, trim the edges to neaten.Cut the dough in half lengthways so that you have 2 long strips, then cut each strip into 6 or 7 triangles with 2 equal sides.Take each triangle in turn and pull the two corners at the base to stretch and widen it.Starting at the base of each triangle, begin to gently roll into a croissant, being careful not to crush the dough.Continue rolling, making sure the tip of each triangle ends up tucked under the croissant to hold in place. If adding any fillings (see tips, below), place across the widest part of the triangle before rolling up.Bend the ends of the croissants inwards, then transfer to baking trays lined with baking parchment, spaced well apart. Cover with lightly oiled cling film and leave to rise for 2 hrs, or until doubled in size.Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Mix the beaten egg with a pinch of salt and use to generously glaze the croissants. Bake for 15-18 mins until risen and golden brown, then cool on wire racks.Try adding different flavours and fillings (step 12). Once you’ve cut the dough into triangles, try… Chocolate: When you’re ready to roll the croissants, arrange strips of dark chocolate along the nearest edge, then continue rolling and shaping them. Almond: Pop strips of marzipan along the edge of the croissants before rolling. After glazing the croissants, sprinkle over some flaked almonds. Click right for more suggestions... • Work as quickly as you can with the dough – if it gets too warm, the butter will begin to melt out. Chill the dough at any point to firm up. • If butter starts to break through the dough, dust the area with a little flour, then continue after chilling. • Making croissants is a labour of love, so don’t waste any dough – cut smaller triangles and make mini croissants from any offcuts.Use your gift card to cook our incredible Antipasti Pasta recipe!",

Cook with the lid on until the onions are soft and squidgy, but not yet starting to colour – 10 mins.Scatter in the ginger, garlic and chillies and fry for a minute or so, then sprinkle in the turmeric, garam masala and paprika. Stir in the chicken and peppers and continue frying for about 10 mins until the spice mixture clings to the chicken and the onions turn russet brown. Add a splash of water if they start to catch on the bottom of the pan.Stir the tomato purée into the yogurt, turn down the heat a fraction and swirl the yogurt into the pan followed by 125ml/4fl oz cold water. Bring to a simmer and cook gently without a lid for about 30-35 mins until the chicken is tender, stirring in a little more water if the sauce becomes dry – it should thicken and take on a warm reddish tinge. Add salt if you want to. (Will keep in the fridge for up to 2 days.) Reheat in a covered casserole in the oven at 200C/fan 180C/gas 6 for 20-30 mins or until bubbling (you may need to stir in a splash of water if the sauce is too thick).

            "Pull the skin off the chicken using kitchen paper to get a good grip. Set the chicken aside. Heat the oil in a large pan over a medium heat – a wok is great for this. Fry the cumin seeds for just a few secs until they give off a lovely nutty aroma, then tip in the onions and turn the heat down low. Cook with the lid on until the onions are soft and squidgy, but not yet starting to colour – 10 mins.",
            "Scatter in the ginger, garlic and chillies and fry for a minute or so, then sprinkle in the turmeric, garam masala and paprika. Stir in the chicken and peppers and continue frying for about 10 mins until the spice mixture clings to the chicken and the onions turn russet brown. Add a splash of water if they start to catch on the bottom of the pan.",
            "Stir the tomato purée into the yogurt, turn down the heat a fraction and swirl the yogurt into the pan followed by 125ml/4fl oz cold water. Bring to a simmer and cook gently without a lid for about 30-35 mins until the chicken is tender, stirring in a little more water if the sauce becomes dry – it should thicken and take on a warm reddish tinge. Add salt if you want to. (Will keep in the fridge for up to 2 days.) Reheat in a covered casserole in the oven at 200C/fan 180C/gas 6 for 20-30 mins or until bubbling (you may need to stir in a splash of water if the sauce is too thick). Scatter over coriander before serving."

Blitz the sauce with a hand blender until reasonably smooth, then reheat in the pan. Serve the lamb on a board, with the sauce for spooning over, and the coriander, mint, chillies and chapatis on the side."

        "description": "Create a mouthwatering chocolate truffle torte - and there's no cooking necessary!Get your equipment ready (see tips below). Break the chocolate in small pieces into a large heatproof bowl. Spoon in the syrup and pour in about a quarter of the cream. Stand the bowl over (not in) a pan of hot water over the lowest possible heat and leave until the chocolate has melted, about 15-20 minutes. Remove the bowl from the pan and stir to combine. Leave until barely warm – dip your little finger in to check.Get your cake tin ready. Do this while you are waiting for the chocolate to melt and cool so you’re not hanging around. Cut open the plastic folder along the bottom, then cut out a disc to fit in the bottom of the tin and 3 strips to line the sides. (See step 2).Pour the rest of the cream into a very large bowl and tip in the coffee and cinnamon. Whip with a balloon whisk until the cream looks like step 3. When you shake the bowl the cream should wobble like a thick milkshake, and when you dribble some cream from the whisk, the trail it leaves in the cream below should disappear in 1-2 seconds.Fold the two together. Pour the cooled chocolate into the bowl containing the cream. With the largest metal spoon you’ve got, fold the cream and chocolate together in a figure-of-eight motion. Don’t be nervous – keep going until they are evenly and smoothly mixed and the mixture has a soft, pillowy, downy texture – you will see and feel it thicken as you fold.Set the torte. Pour the chocolatey cream into the tin and level the surface with the back of the spoon. Put the tin in the fridge and leave to firm up. This can happen in under an hour, but you may need to leave it longer, depending on the coldness of your fridge (you can leave it overnight if this is more convenient).Unmould and serve. Unclip and remove the side of the tin, then remove the pieces of plastic around the sides. Invert a serving plate over the torte and turn the torte upside down on to it. Lift off the tin base and peel away the plastic. Dust all over with cocoa (including the plate if you wish to be fashionable) and serve in thin slices.For a nutty finish, sprinkle\r\nwith 25g/1oz chopped toasted\r\nhazelnuts instead of the cocoa. Or for chocolate orange torte,\r\nomit the coffee and whip the\r\ncream with the cinnamon\r\nand 2 tsp finely grated orange\r\nzest. Decorate with\r\nroughly-chopped chocolate\r\ncoated orange peel (try Duchy\r\nOriginals).You'll need a small cake tin with a loose base- an 18cm springform tin (the type with sides that unclip) is ideal- you can use a larger tin but it will make the torte shallower. A tip I’ve picked up from chefs is to line the tin with plastic to get a smooth edge, so you’ll also need an (unused) A4 clear plastic folder. You could use cling film, but take care to get it well into the corners of the tin as the torte will take the exact shape of the cling film, wrinkles and all.Use your gift card to cook our incredible Antipasti Pasta recipe!",

Next, add the milk a little at a time, stirring continuously.Finally, add the can of condensed milk and stir well until it is fully incorporated. Keep stirring as the dulce de leche bubbles and thickens over a medium heat. It will need a further 5-10 mins of cooking. It will turn a darker shade of brown and take on a slight orange-red hue as it darkens. It should be thick enough to leave a clear channel in the pan when a spoon is run through and then add a pinch of salt. It will firm up as it cools. The dulce de leche can be stored in a jar in the fridge and will keep for up to a month.

Using only a handful of ingredients, bread-making has never been so easyTip the flour, yeast, sugar, salt and oil into a bowl. Pour over 325ml warm water, then mix (with a spatula or your hand), until it comes together as a shaggy dough. Make sure all the flour has been incorporated. Cover and leave for 10 mins.Lightly oil your work surface and tip the dough onto it. Knead the dough for at least 10 mins until it becomes tighter and springy – if you have a stand mixer you can do this with a dough hook for 5 mins. Pull the dough into a ball and put in a clean, oiled bowl. Leave for 1 hr, or until doubled in size.Tip the dough onto a lightly floured surface and roll into a long sausage shape. Halve the dough, then divide each half into four pieces, so you have eight equal-sized portions. Roll each into a tight ball and put on a dusted baking tray, leaving some room between each ball for rising. Cover with a damp tea towel and leave in a warm place to prove for 40 mins-1 hr or until almost doubled in size.Heat the oven to 230C/210C fan/gas 8. When the dough is ready, dust each ball with a bit more flour. (If you like, you can glaze the rolls with milk or beaten egg, and top with seeds.) Bake for 25-30mins, until light brown and hollow sounding when tapped on the base. Leave to cool on a wire rack.This recipe makes smallish rolls but can easily be adjusted. For burger buns, divide the mix into six instead of eight, or for hotdog buns, roll them into finger shapes instead of balls.For wholemeal rolls, use 250g white flour and 250g of wholemeal flour.Use your gift card to cook our incredible Antipasti Pasta recipe!",

        "description": "Our easy vanilla cake has a beautifully moist and fluffy sponge drenched with vanilla syrup. Use it as the basis for a range of fabulous celebration cakesHeat oven to 160C/140C fan/gas 3. Grease a round, deep 20cm tin, then line the base and sides with non-stick baking paper.Using electric beaters or a tabletop mixer, beat the butter, sugar, vanilla and ¼ tsp salt together until pale and fluffy, then pour in the eggs, one at a time, giving the mix a really good beating before adding the next.Add 1 tbsp of the plain flour if the mix starts to look slimy rather than fluffy. Beat in the yogurt. Mix the flours; then, using a large metal spoon, fold them into the batter, followed by the milk.Spoon the mix into the tin and bake for 1 hr 20 mins or until well risen and golden – a skewer inserted into the middle should come out clean.Meanwhile, make the syrup by gently heating 50ml water with the sugar and vanilla in a pan until the sugar dissolves. Set aside. Once the cake is out of the oven, leave to cool for 30 mins in the tin, then use a skewer to poke holes all over the cake, going right to the bottom. Pour the syrup over, letting it completely soak in after each addition.Leave to cool completely, then either wrap the cake well or fill and ice it. If you wrap it with baking parchment and cling film, the unfilled cake will keep well for up to 3 days, or in the freezer for up to a month.For ideas on how to decorate the cake and to try out some variations on this basic cake mixture, have a look at the 'Goes well with' recipes for Simple elegance wedding cake, Birthday bug cake and Summer celebration cake.Vanilla cake is a basic sponge which is enriched with vanilla flavouring and typically covered in a plain buttercream. It is made by using the creaming method whereby butter and sugar are creamed together before being mixed with eggs and finally folded with flour. It is similar to the American pound cake which uses equal quantities of butter, sugar and flour. However this recipe also contains yoghurt which keeps the sponge damp and being slightly acidic helps activate the self raising flour..For the best flavour, we recommend making your own syrup using a vanilla pod or vanilla bean paste heated with caster sugar. It is worth paying a little extra to buy good quality vanilla extract and avoid anything that says vanilla essence or flavouring, as the flavour is much deeper from real vanilla pods.Use your gift card to cook our incredible Antipasti Pasta recipe!",

It should be spreadable and not run off the cake.This recipe for a classic cream cheese frosting combines butter, icing sugar and full-fat cream cheese. It’s important to use full-fat cream cheese as the lower-fat options won’t whip as thickly. You can also use a little orange juice for a hint of citrus.If the consistency is too thin or runny you can put the frosting mixture in the fridge for up to 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.If it’s still too thin, take out some of the runny mixture and beat in some more cream cheese. Alternatively, if you whisk it with an electric whisk or in a stand mixer with a whisk attachment on high it will thicken after 3-4 minutes.Give this cream cheese mixture an extra flavour boost by adding the following ingredients:Some of our favourite recipes with cream cheese frosting include:Easy carrot cakeCarrot cake cupcakesRed velvet cakeBanana traybake with cream cheese frostingPumpkin spice cupcakesUse your gift card to cook our incredible Antipasti Pasta recipe!",

You won't want your turkey leftovers to ever run out while this is in the fridgeCut each mango in half down the sides of the flat stone that runs through the centre of the fruit, so that you end up with 2 fleshy halves. Now take each mango half and cut into the flesh, making quite chunky diagonal pieces – take care not to cut through the skin. Turn each half inside out, then slice away the chunks of mango that stand proud from the skin. Cut the flesh from around the stones, trim off the skin and chop the flesh.Heat the oil in a large, deep sauté pan, add the onion and fry for a few mins until starting to soften. Stir in the ginger and cook, stirring frequently, for about 8-10 mins until the onion is golden. Stir in all of the spices, except the turmeric, and fry until toasted.Stir in the turmeric, add the apple and pour in 500ml water, then cover the pan and cook for 10 mins. Stir in the mango and chilli, then cover and cook for 20 mins more until the apple is pulpy and the mango is tender.Pour in the vinegar, stir in the sugar and salt, then leave to simmer uncovered for 30 mins, stirring frequently (especially towards the end of the cooking time so that it doesn’t stick) until the mixture is pulpy rather than watery. Spoon into sterilised jars.Homemade chutney makes a lovely gift fora friend, but for me it is also an essential partof Boxing Day to serve with cold turkey andham.

Our simple homemade fresh pasta recipe can be used to make any style or shapePut the flour in a food processor with ¾ of your egg mixture and a pinch of salt. Blitz to large crumbs – they should come together to form a dough when squeezed (if it feels a little dry gradually add a bit more egg). Tip the dough onto a lightly floured surface, knead for 1 min or until nice and smooth – don’t worry if it’s quite firm as it will soften when it rests. Cover with cling film and leave to rest for 30 mins.Cut away ¼ of the dough (keep the rest covered with cling film) and feed it through the widest setting on your pasta machine. (If you don’t have a machine, use a heavy rolling pin to roll the dough as thinly as possible.) Then fold into three, give the dough a quarter turn and feed through the pasta machine again. Repeat this process once more then continue to pass the dough through the machine, progressively narrowing the rollers, one notch at a time, until you have a smooth sheet of pasta. On the narrowest setting, feed the sheet through twice.Cut as required to use for filled pastas like tortellini, or cut into lengths to make spaghetti, linguine, tagliatelle, or pappardelle. Then, dust in semolina flour and set aside, or hang until dry (an hour will be enough time.) Store in a sealed container in the fridge and use within a couple of days, or freeze for 1 month.There are two types of fresh pasta:Traditionally, ‘00’ flour is used for egg pasta as it’s high in gluten, which stops the pasta from snapping when rolling out or cutting into strands. This ’00’ flour is wheat flour that has been put through the mill twice, so it's very fine. It has a higher protein count than plain white flour, which is important for the structure of the dough. It can be found in most large supermarkets. You can also make pasta with plain or plain strong flour, but it will be harder to work with. Self-raising flour shouldn’t be used to make pasta as it puffs up when cooked.See our guide for how to make pasta for more info on pasta shapes and ingredients.You may need to add a touch of water to the dough if it feels too dry. Make the dough with your hands so you can feel the texture. Add 1 tsp water at a time and work it into the dough before adding more.Add a sprinkling of flour under the ball of dough while you’re kneading it on the work surface, adding a little at a time until the dough stops sticking.Fresh pasta that has been dried out properly will last a week in an airtight container in a cool place. Undried fresh pasta should either be used that day or frozen. Filled pasta should be frozen if not being used straightaway; freeze it on baking sheets and store in freezer bags once solid. Remember: the egg in the pasta is raw, so you need to store it properly.Freeze pasta that's been cut into strips in ‘nests’ or cut into lasagne sheets (keep these separated into sheets) and cook from frozen. Fresh, undried pasta is extremely quick cooking; dried and frozen pasta will need another couple of minutes.For an egg dough, it’s best to invest in a pasta machine. Of course, the original way to roll pasta is with a rolling pin, but without a lot of practice and a very long rolling pin, it's difficult to get it thin enough and to the right consistency. Flour and water pasta is not rolled into sheets and is easier to make.For a visual demonstration, watch our video on how to make pasta with a machine.Once you have shaped your pasta, you can cook it straightaway, leave it out to cook later that day or freeze it flat or coiled into nests on flour-dusted trays (freezing pasta can retain the texture better). Pasta can be cooked straight from frozen – allow a few more minutes of cooking time and taste for doneness. How long your homemade fresh pasta will take will depend on the shape it is – start at 1 minute 30 seconds and cook for up to 4 minutes, testing every 30 seconds.Use your gift card to cook our incredible Antipasti Pasta recipe!",

        "description": "Take cinnamon whirls to a new level of indulgence with this giant version. Perfect for a party, it takes a little more effort but the results are well worth itFor the dough, gently heat the milk and butter until the butter has just melted. Leave to cool until just warm to the touch (it shouldn’t be hot). Tip the flour into a large bowl with the yeast, cinnamon, sugar and a pinch of salt. Pour in the warm butter and milk mixture along with the egg, then combine with your hands until a dough forms. Tip the dough out onto a floured surface, and knead for about 10 mins until springy. Alternatively, you can do this in a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook – the dough will only require about 5 mins of kneading using this method. Bring the dough together into a ball, then place in an oiled bowl. Cover with a clean tea towel and leave to rise for about 1 hr, or until doubled in size.Meanwhile, beat the filling ingredients with a small pinch of salt using an electric whisk until completely combined. Set aside. Butter a 20cm springform or loose-bottomed cake tin. Tip the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead briefly to knock the air out. Leave to rest for a few minutes, then roll out to a 30 x 50cm rectangle, and lay it on the surface so the short edge is facing you. Spread over the filling so the dough rectangle is completely covered. Cut the dough into four strips down the length. Roll the first strip up into a tight spiral from the short end, then place the spiral at the short end of the second strip and roll this up into a spiral around the first. Place this larger spiral at the short end of the third strip and roll up again, then repeat with the final strip of dough. You should end up with one large cinnamon bun. Transfer to the prepared tin, cover with a clean tea towel and leave to rise for 45 mins-1 hr, or until it has risen by about a third.Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Put the cake tin on a baking tray and bake for 50 mins-1 hr until puffed up, golden and cooked through. Meanwhile, combine the icing sugar, vanilla and 3 tbsp water until you have a loose icing that can be drizzled. Leave the bun to cool in the tin for 10 mins, then remove from the tin, drizzle with the icing and leave to cool completely on a wire rack. Serve in slices, or let everyone pull it apart.

Grease a 20cm round cake tin and line with cling film (you can use the 23cm tin that you will bake the cake in, but you’ll have to make this the day before so that you can remove it before making the cake). Remove the zest from 4 of the oranges and set aside for the cake. Tip the orange juice and sugar into a saucepan and gently heat to dissolve the sugar. Meanwhile, soak the gelatine leaves in cold water for a few mins until soft. Remove the gelatine from the water, squeeze out any excess and add to the warm orange juice, stir until the gelatine has dissolved. Pour the liquid into the lined cake tin and chill for at least 4 hrs or preferably overnight.Heat oven to 160C/140C fan/gas 3 and line a 23cm round cake tin with baking parchment. Tip all the cake ingredients into a large mixing bowl and combine with an electric hand whisk until smooth. Spoon into the tin and smooth over the surface. Bake in the centre of the oven for 55 mins, or until a skewer inserted comes out clean. Cool in the tin for 15 mins, then invert onto a wire rack and leave to cool completely.Now make the ganache. Heat the cream in a small pan until hot. Put the chocolate in a small bowl and pour over the cream, leave for 10 mins, then mix well – you should be left with a smooth chocolate sauce. Leave at room temperature until the ganache cools and thickens a little (you can put it in the fridge to speed this up, but keep an eye on it, as it will set quickly).To assemble the cake, place it on a cake stand and trim the top to give you a flat surface. Warm the apricot jam in the microwave until a little runny. Paint it over the top of the cake, then flip the orange jelly out of its tin, and position on top. Using a palette knife, swirl the chocolate ganache over the orange jelly, letting it dribble down the sides of the cake a little.

Bubble for 1-2 mins, mixing to combine. Set aside to cool a little. Put the flour, bicarbonate of soda and spices in a bowl, add the warm syrup mixture and the egg, and stir to combine (it will feel a little soft now, but will firm up once chilled). Cover the bowl with cling film and chill for 30 mins. Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6 and line 2 baking trays with parchment.Dust your work surface with a little flour, then roll out the dough to the thickness of a £1 coin. Cut out as many men and ladies as you can – you should be able to get about 16 by re-rolling the dough. Place on the trays, then bake for 10-12 mins until slightly risen and golden brown. While they are still warm, push a straw through the top of the gingerbread ladies, and just above where the legs meet on the gingerbread men, to make a hole for stringing up. Cool on a wire rack.To decorate your snowmen, divide the icing sugar evenly between 2 bowls. Add enough water, a dribble at a time, until you have a very thick but pipeable icing. Add a few drops of brown food colouring to one bowl of icing brown for the reindeer and mix until evenly coloured. Spoon 2 tbsp of the brown icing into another bowl, then colour black using the black food colouring.Transfer roughly half the white icing to a piping bag fitted with a fine nozzle. Pipe the outline of a snowman onto the gingerbread lady biscuits, piping a little circle around the hole at the top too. Leave to set for 5 mins. Squeeze any leftover icing back into the bowl with the remaining white icing and add a little more water, a splash at a time, until runny but still fairly thick. Transfer back to the piping bag. When the snowman outlines are dry to the touch, pipe enough icing onto the biscuits to flood the surface. Tease the icing into all corners using a cocktail stick.Use half an orange jelly bean for the snowman’s nose and silver balls for the buttons. Transfer the brown and black icings to piping bags fitted with small nozzles (or snip off the corner of a sandwich bag), and pipe on brown twigs for arms and black dots as coal for eyes and a mouth. Finally, sprinkle the base of each snowman with a little edible glitter.

Add the egg, then beat through all of the remaining dry ingredients apart from the caster sugar. Chill the mixture in the fridge for 1 hr.Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 4. Line two baking sheets with baking parchment. Roll the mixture into 20 even-sized balls (weighing for accuracy, if you like). Tip the caster sugar onto a small plate, then add each ball and roll around to coat. Space each ball out on the baking sheets. Bake for 9-10 mins until golden brown. Leave to cool completely on a wire rack.The key ingredients in these cookies are flour, butter, eggs, sugar (brown for the dough mixture and caster for rolling the balls in before baking), black treacle and spices.Ideally gingerbread cookies should be soft in texture if you cook them for 9-10 minutes, but you can bake them for a few extra minutes if you prefer more of a crunchy biscuit.We’ve gone for a simple round shape, but you can get creative with cutters and make them into gingerbread men, stars, trees and plenty more. See our guide to the best ever gingerbread recipes for shape inspiration.Whilst ground ginger is of course the predominant flavour this recipe also includes a pinch of ground cloves and cinnamon for extra spice. You can also add additional spices such as nutmeg, cardamom and allspice, or even grate in some orange or lemon zest for a hint of citrus. Adding black treacle to the dough also gives the cookies a deep caramel flavour.If you have any stem ginger, grate and put into the mixture for a stronger ginger kick.You can freeze these gingerbread cookies in balls in an airtight container and then bake them from frozen, adding an extra 5 minutes to the cooking time.The cookie dough will not be sturdy enough to be used to form a larger structure.

        "description": "Gregg Wallace fell in love with Michel Roux Snr's lemon tart at first bite. This is his version of the classic recipeTo make the pastry, mix the flour and icing sugar in a bowl. Rub the butter into the flour with your fingers until crumbly. Mix in the egg yolks. If the pastry is still too dry, add 1-2 tbsp water until it comes together. Roll into a ball and divide in half (freeze one half for another recipe). Flatten out the pastry with your hands, wrap the dough in cling film, then chill for at least 30 mins. While the pastry is chilling, make the filling. Beat all the ingredients, except for the zest, together. Sieve the mixture, then stir in the zest.Roll out the pastry on a lightly floured surface to about the thickness of a £1 coin, then lift into a 23cm tart tin. Press down gently on the bottom and sides, then trim off any excess pastry. Stab a few holes in the bottom with a fork and put back in the fridge for 30 mins.Heat oven to 160C/140C fan/gas 3. Line the tart with foil and fill with rice or dried beans. Bake for 10 mins, then remove the tart tin from the oven, discard the foil, and bake for another 20 mins until biscuity. When the pastry is ready, remove it from the oven, pour in the lemon mixture and bake again for 30-35 mins until just set. Leave to cool, then remove the tart from the tin and serve at room temperature or chilled.The quantity of pastry given is about doublethe amount that you’ll need because if I’mgoing to the effort of making my own pastry,I always make double and freeze half fornext time.

The veg can be roasted a day ahead and kept chilled.To assemble, unravel the filo pastry. Brush one sheet liberally with some of the remaining oil, and keep the rest covered with a damp tea towel to stop it drying out. Drape the oiled sheet, oiled-side down, into a 22cm loose-bottomed cake tin so that some of the pastry hangs over the side. Repeat with another sheet of pastry, turning it by about 45 degrees over the first sheet in the tin, then again with the last two pastry sheets.Spoon in the filling, then pull the overhanging pastry up and towards the centre, scrunching it to enclose the filling.

Sit the chicken on a board, breast-side down with the wing-end away from you. Use a strong pair of kitchen scissors to cut along either side of the backbone to remove it, cutting through the ribs as you go. Open out the chicken like a book, flip so it is now breast- side up, then press down on the breasts with the heel of your hand to flatten slightly – you are trying to get an even thickness across the whole joint. If you have any long skewers, diagonally criss-cross two, skewering through the legs and breast to hold in position. Sit the chicken in a dish or roasting tin. Mix the lemon zest and juice, olive oil and thyme with some pepper, rub all over the chicken, then cover and chill for up to a day.Get the beans ready by gently frying the pancetta in a pan – you shouldn’t need any extra oil if you start it slowly. When the pancetta is golden and crisp, lift it out with a slotted spoon, then add the celery and garlic to the remaining fat in the pan. Gently cook for 10-12 mins until soft. Scrape into a medium-size deep roasting tin or baking dish with the pancetta, butter beans, thyme, wine, stock and plenty of seasoning. Set aside until ready to cook.Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Transfer the chicken to a rack, breastside up, that will rest above the beans (sit the beans on a large baking sheet if the chicken overhangs at all, to keep your oven clean). Season the chicken with salt and roast for 40-50 mins until the chicken is cooked through – cut into one of the legs to check. Lift the chicken out to rest for 10 mins. If the beans are a bit soupy, transfer to the hob and simmer for a minute to reduce some of the juices – they should still be nice and wet though.To serve, cut the legs, thighs and wings from the chicken, then thickly carve or tear off the breast in chunks. Check the beans for seasoning, then stir through the parsley and serve with the chicken.Heat the barbecue and cook the chickenfor 20-25 mins on each side until golden,crisp and cooked through. If your BBQhas a lid, pull it down. If it doesn’t, thenupturn a large roasting tin or baking dishover the chicken while it cooks.Meanwhile, cook the beans in theoven as in the recipe, stirring in a splashmore stock towards the end if they lookat all dry, and adding in any resting juicesfrom the chicken before serving.Use your gift card to cook our incredible Antipasti Pasta recipe!",

Set aside and leave to cool.Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Toss the squash with 1 tbsp oil in a roasting tin. Season and roast for 25-30 mins until soft, stirring after 20 mins to prevent the squash from burning.Meanwhile, oil a 24cm bundt or savarin tin. Line the base with baking parchment – this is easier if you cut out smaller rectangular pieces of parchment and overlap them in the base. Heat another 1 tbsp oil in a frying pan over a low heat and cook the onions until tender, about 8 mins. Add the mushrooms, season and cook for another 5-8 mins, or until the mushrooms are soft and any liquid they’ve released has evaporated. Remove from the heat and leave to cool slightly. Mix the flaxseed with 8 tbsp hot water, and leave until the mixture is gel-like.Rub a little oil over the whole sage leaves and arrange in the base of the tin. Press the fruit topping over the leaves so the base is fully covered.Combine the roasted squash, cooled onion and mushroom mixture, flaxseed, nutmeg, breadcrumbs, chopped sage leaves, rosemary, lentils and chestnuts. Season well, then pack into the tin over the fruit. Cover with foil. The unbaked wreath will keep, covered in the fridge, for two days.With the oven still at 200C/180C fan/gas 6, bake the wreath for 45 mins, then remove the foil and bake for another 15 mins.

Mix honey and mustard for a fantastic dip to go with themPut the flour, yeast, sugar and 1 tsp salt in a large bowl and mix together to combine. In a large jug, mix together 300ml lukewarm water and the butter. Make a well in the flour mixture and pour in the water, mixing together to form a rough dough.Tip out onto a floured work surface and knead for 10-15 mins or until smooth and elastic. Put the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with oiled cling film and set aside until doubled in size, about 1hr.Once risen, knock out the air bubbles in the dough and divide into 8 equal pieces. Using your hands, roll each piece into a long rope about 60cm long.To form into pretzels, lay the rope in a U-shape with the curve pointing towards you. Take the two ends and cross them over.Take the ends, lift them backwards and press them into the curve of the U-shape. Repeat with the remaining dough. Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6.Carefully place the pretzels on a baking tray lined with parchment and lightly greased with oil. Cover lightly with oiled cling film. Set aside for about 20 mins until puffy (not fully risen like bread dough).Fill a medium-sized saucepan with water, bring to the boil, add the baked bicarbonate of soda, then reduce the heat to a low simmer.

        "description": "This traditional Greek spinach and feta cheese pie gets a healthier makeover - we've slashed the fat, salt and caloriesPack the spinach into a large heatproof bowl. Pour boiling water over and press the spinach down with a wooden spoon. Leave for 1 min to wilt, stirring a couple of times so all the leaves are submerged. Tip into a large colander and place under running cold water to cool quickly. Drain well – squeeze out any excess water by pressing the spinach down with the wooden spoon, then squeezing with your hands. Using kitchen paper, pat the spinach dry into a compact shape, lay it on a board and roughly chop, then set aside.Heat 2 tsp of the oil in a large non-stick frying pan. Add the shallot, spring onions and garlic, and fry over a high-ish heat for 3-4 mins, stirring often, until softened and just starting to brown. Lower the heat, tip in the spinach and stir for 1 min only to finish drying. Season with pepper and a good pinch of nutmeg, and leave to cool.Heat oven to 190C/170C fan/gas 5 and put a baking sheet in to heat up. In a bowl, stir the ricotta into the beaten egg and mix in the 2 tbsp dill, the chives and mint. Season with pepper and a pinch of salt.Lightly oil a 20cm square x 4cm deep cake tin. Mix the remaining oil with the 1 rounded tsp dill. Lay the filo pastry sheets on a large board. Brush the top one with a little of the dill oil, then carefully lower it into the tin to line the base and 2 of the sides, with an overhang on both sides. The pastry doesn’t have to fit in smoothly – a few wrinkles and folds in it are fine. Brush a bit more oil over the second pastry sheet and this time lay it down in the tin the other way round, so it drapes over and lines the base and the other 2 sides. The tin should now be completely covered, with a pastry overhang all round. Repeat the criss-cross layering with 2 more oiled filo sheets.Stir the ricotta mixture into the spinach, then crumble in the feta. Lightly stir it in so you leave a few chunky pieces. Spoon this filling into the lined tin and level it. Bring the pastry sides up and over the filling, then brush a little oil over them. Brush the remainder of the oil over the last filo sheet on the board. Cut the sheet in half widthways and lay one half over at a time, in big folds, to cover the filling and give you a pastry topping.Place the tin on the heated baking sheet and bake for 25-30 mins until the pastry is crisp and golden. Leave to cool for 10-15 mins. Remove the tin and transfer to a serving plate. If your tin doesn’t have a loose bottom, carefully upturn it onto a flat board, then flip it over onto the serving plate. Serve warm or cold with minted yogurt dip and a tomato, cucumber & pepper salad (see below), if you like.To make a simple minted yogurt dip, mix 8 tbsp of 2% Greek yogurt with 1 tbsp chopped mint and season with black pepper. For added crunch, and another helping of veg, mix up a salad of sliced tomatoes (try red and yellow ones), thin slices of red onion plus red pepper, chunks of cucumber and a sprinkling of snipped chives. To make a simple minted yogurt dip, mix 8 tbsp of 2% Greek yogurt with 1 tbsp chopped mint and season with black pepper. For added crunch, and another helping of veg, mix up a salad of sliced tomatoes (try red and yellow ones), thin slices of red onion plus red pepper, chunks of cucumber and a sprinkling of snipped chives. To make a simple minted yogurt dip, mix 8 tbsp of 2% Greek yogurt with 1 tbsp chopped mint and season with black pepper. For added crunch, and another helping of veg, mix up a salad of sliced tomatoes (try red and yellow ones), thin slices of red onion plus red pepper, chunks of cucumber and a sprinkling of snipped chives. To make a simple minted yogurt dip, mix 8 tbsp of 2% Greek yogurt with 1 tbsp chopped mint and season with black pepper. For added crunch, and another helping of veg, mix up a salad of sliced tomatoes (try red and yellow ones), thin slices of red onion plus red pepper, chunks of cucumber and a sprinkling of snipped chives. To make a simple minted yogurt dip, mix 8 tbsp of 2% Greek yogurt with 1 tbsp chopped mint and season with black pepper. For added crunch, and another helping of veg, mix up a salad of sliced tomatoes (try red and yellow ones), thin slices of red onion plus red pepper, chunks of cucumber and a sprinkling of snipped chives. I used a non-stick frying pan, so I needed very little oil. To reduce saturated fat, I used rapeseed oil for frying and for brushing the pastry. Fat, saturated fat and salt were lowered by replacing some of the feta with ricotta.

Put the milk and butter into a medium pan and heat gently until the butter melts and the milk is at a simmer. Cool for a few mins, then beat in the eggs with a fork. Mix the dry ingredients in a large bowl with 1½ tsp fine salt, then add the liquid and stir to a sticky dough. Leave for 5 mins, then tip onto a floured worktop and knead for 5-10 mins until smooth and springy. Use a little oil to grease a large bowl, add the dough, turn it in the oil to coat, then cover the bowl with clingfilm. Leave in a warm place for 1 hr or until doubled in size. Knead in a tabletop mixer with a dough hook if you prefer.To assemble, grease a 25cm bundt pan with butter. Melt the rest of the butter in a pan. In a medium bowl mix the spices and sugar plus a pinch of salt. Spoon 2 tbsp melted butter, 3 tbsp spiced sugar and 4 tbsp pecans into the bottom of the tin.Pull the dough into about 65 small pieces and roll into balls. Taking 4 or 5 at a time, dunk the dough balls into the melted butter, let the excess drain off, then tip them into the spiced sugar. Roll to coat, then put haphazardly into the tin. Repeat until there’s a full layer of dough in the tin. Scatter with the rest of the chopped nuts, then carry on filling the tin with the coated dough balls. Tip any leftover sugar and butter over the dough. Can be frozen now for up to 1 month. Defrost in the fridge then let prove.Cover the pan with oiled clingfilm then leave to rise in a warm place for 1 hr, or until risen and the dough no longer springs back when you poke it.Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Bake the monkey bread for 35 mins, or until well risen and golden. Let the pan cool for 5 mins, then give it a sharp rap on the counter. Leave in the tin until just warm.Whisk all of the ingredients together to make the glaze. It will thicken as the melted butter cools. Turn the monkey bread onto a serving plate, then drizzle with the glaze. Let it set, if you can bear the wait.To make this for next morning, you can let the dough prove in the tin in the fridge overnight. Let it acclimatise at room temperature for 45 mins-1hr in the morning, to complete the proving, then bake.I always tend to toast nuts before using them in baking as it enhances their flavour and adds crunch.

You can't beat an oozy stuffed crustYou can make the pizza dough up to 48 hrs before you want to cook the pizza. Warm the milk in a saucepan until steaming but not boiling. In a large bowl combine the flour, yeast, sugar and 1 tsp salt. Add 1/2 tbsp oil to the milk and leave to cool until just warm –when you place a finger in the liquid it should feel body temperature. Pour the liquid into the bowl and either mix with a wooden spoon or food mixer, until the ingredients are well combined. Tip out onto your work surface and knead for 10 mins, or continue mixing in the mixer for 5-7 mins, until you have a smooth and elastic dough. Clean and oil the bowl, return the dough and cover with cling film. Leave somewhere warm to rise for 1-2 hrs, until doubled in size, or place in the fridge for up to 48 hrs.Meanwhile, make the sauce. Pour the remaining oil and passata into a saucepan and add the squashed garlic, oregano and a pinch of sugar. Season well and simmer for 5-10 mins, until the sauce is thick. Remove the garlic cloves and set aside until you’re ready to assemble the pizza.If the dough has been chilled remove from the fridge and leave at room temperature for 1 hr. Dust the work surface with polenta and tip the dough onto it. Punch the dough down to knock out the air bubbles then shape into a disk. Roll out the dough to a pizza base, about 35cm wide. Dust a large baking sheet with polenta and place the dough on top, making sure the dough can move around freely. Use 125g of the mozzarella to create a ring around the outside edge of the pizza base, leaving 1/2cm gap between the edge. Brush a little water inside the mozzarella ring then fold over the outside edge to enclose the mozzarella and create a stuffed crust. Press firmly to stick the dough in place.Spoon the sauce over the middle of the base and top with the remaining mozzarella.

        "title": "How to make oat milk",
        "description": "Make our easy oat milk recipe using just one ingredient. It’s ideal if you’re lactose intolerant or want a vegan alternative to cow's milkPut the porridge oats in a bowl and cover with tap water until the oats are submerged. Cover the bowl (a shower cap or teatowel work well) and leave for 4 hrs or overnight, somewhere cool, but not in the fridge.Sieve the mixture, discarding the water, and rinse under the tap for a few seconds.Tip the oats into a liquidiser, or food processor. Cover with 750ml cold water and ½ tsp fine sea salt. Blend for 2-4 mins until completely smooth, and there are no oats visible. The finer you make the mixture, the creamier the milk will be.Line a sieve with a clean piece of muslin, or a cloth with a mesh – it needs to have small holes, so a j-cloth or teatowel might not work. (You could also try a fine strainer or meshed coffee filter.)Put the lined sieve over a bowl or jug, and pour in the oat milk. Leave to strain for 1 hr. Every once in a while, use a spoon to scrape the bottom of the cloth to disperse some of the sediment, this will help speed up the straining.When most of the liquid is in the jug, gather the sides of the muslin together and squeeze tightly with both hands to extract the last of the milk. Discard leftover oat pulp (or make a body scrub by adding used coffee grounds).If you want thinner consistency, add 50ml cold water to the mix, before pouring into a bottle or container. See our troubleshooting tips below. Will keep for 2-3 days in the fridge. Shake well before use. Porridge oats are soaked in water, then blended and strained to create a creamy, dairy-free milk substitute.Porridge oats and rolled oats work well. We would avoid using jumbo oats, as they are a lot bigger, more difficult to blend and will need longer to soak. The coarser the oats, the longer they take to soak. After you’ve soaked them, try pressing one of the oats between your fingers; if it’s completely soft, they’re ready to be drained and blended.First, make sure that you don’t over-blend the oats – blitz them in a high-powered blender for no more than 45 seconds. If you blend them for too long, they’ll start to warm up – similar to porridge, this will cause the oats to become more gelatinous and slimy.You should also avoid soaking the oats for too long, as they will absorb more water and therefore become slimy. Finally, make sure you remove the excess starch by straining thoroughly. If you find your results are still slimy, we’d recommend straining the oat milk twice.The leftover oat milk pulp can be used for lots of things. Specifically, it can be blitzed into soups and sauces to thicken them and make them creamy. It can also be made into porridge by adding a few tablespoons of fresh oats, a splash of milk and whatever toppings you like.The cereal grain’s proven benefits include helping lower high blood pressure and reduce bad cholesterol. Oats are also packed with vitamins, minerals and fibre. Read our guide to the health benefits of oats for more information.A liquidiser works best, as it will blend the oats very finely. Or, use a food processor if you don’t have one. A hand blender will also work, but make sure you blitz until really smooth or your oat milk will end up too watery.You have to be patient with the process of making oat milk, as it takes a while to strain. If it stops passing through the muslin (this may also happen if you’re using a particularly fine cloth), use a spoon and stir the sediment at the bottom of the muslin. If it gets completely stuck, transfer to a clean cloth and wash the first one under the tap before using again.If it’s just water that comes through, the cloth may be too thick to allow the oat milk to pass. Try a tea towel or fine mesh sieve. If it’s too thin, this is normally because you haven’t squeezed out the sediment at the bottom enough. Simply squeeze the muslin tight to press some of the creamy liquid through, as this is what makes the oat milk thick and creamy.Whisk in some cold water until the oat milk reaches your desired consistency.Like coconut milk, this is completely normal – simply shake or stir the oat milk before using it. If it separates when you add it to coffee, it’s just because the of the coffee reacts with the milk and it ends up separating the fat from the liquid, especially if the milk is cold and the coffee is piping hot.Use your gift card to cook our incredible Antipasti Pasta recipe!",

Heat 1 tbsp of the oil in a shallow ovenproof casserole over a medium heat and gently fry the sausages for 5-8 mins, or until brown on all sides. Transfer to a plate using tongs. Tip the onions into the pan and fry for 5-8 mins until beginning to turn golden. Drizzle in a little more oil if the onions start to stick. Sprinkle in the sugar and cook for a minute before stirring in the vinegar, tomato purée and paprika to form a paste. Tip in the tomatoes, then pour the wine into the tomato can, swish it round, and add to the pan. Stir in the bay leaves and beans, then arrange the sausages on top so they’re half-submerged in the sauce but still a little exposed.Bring the mixture to a simmer, then bake in the oven for 20 mins. Meanwhile, make the topping. Mix the breadcrumbs with the garlic and parsley, then season and stir in 1 tbsp oil. Scatter the topping over the casserole, then drizzle with the remaining 1 tbsp oil and bake for 10 mins more until the breadcrumbs are golden and crisp. Leave to stand for a few minutes, then take to the table and serve from the dish.RECIPE TIPSDon’t rinse the beans before adding them, as the liquid contains flavour and starch, which helps to thicken the sauce.You can also make this recipe with puy or green lentils. Add 200g lentils instead of beans, and pour over 200ml stock (vegetable or chicken) with the wine, then cook as stated (or until the lentils are soft).Swap the sausages for skin-on chicken thighs – simply brown these well in the pan, in step one, instead of the sausages.Cannellini, flageolet and borlotti beans or chickpeas would all work well in this dish.Use your gift card to cook our incredible Antipasti Pasta recipe!",

You can add dried fruit, seeds and nuts, grated apple or pear or chopped tropical fruits for the perfect healthy breakfastThe night before serving, stir the cinnamon and 100ml water (or milk) into your oats with a pinch of salt.The next day, loosen with a little more water (or milk) if needed. Top with the yogurt, berries, a drizzle of honey and the nut butter.Overnight oats are basically oats which have been left to soak overnight in milk or water, rather than being cooked in the morning. This no-cook method allows the oats to absorb the liquid overnight and soften them so that they are ready to eat in the morning. This makes overnight oats a quick and easy breakfast option, and you can easily customise them with different toppings and sauces.You can find plenty of ideas for mixing up this versatile breakfast in our collection of overnight oat recipes.

Cut the broccoli into medium-size florets.To make the warm broccoli salad, cook the florets in a pan of boiling salted water for 1 min until just cooked. While the broccoli is cooking, put a frying pan on to heat. As soon as the broccoli is cooked, drain it, then tip straight into the hot frying pan to ‘scorch’ out all the moisture.Turn off the heat, then scatter the orange segments over the broccoli. Toss for a few moments just to heat through, then tip into a bowl and dress with the orange juice and 2 tbsp olive oil. Season with pepper and a small sprinkling of sea salt, then set aside.Wipe out the pan. Season the fish with a little salt and pepper just before cooking. Heat the frying pan until very hot, then add 2 tbsp oil. Lay the fish fillets in the pan, skin-side down. As soon as it goes in, press each fillet down with your fingers or a fish slice to stop it from curling up.Reduce the heat to medium, then leave the fish to cook for 3-4 mins, undisturbed, until you can see that the flesh has cooked two-thirds of the way up and the skin is crisp and brown.Flip the fillets over, then fry on the flesh side for about 2 mins until just done, basting the skin with the oil in the pan as it cooks.

If you like, they can be prepared up to a day ahead and kept in the fridge, uncovered, so that they dry out.Tip the sugar, butter, star anise, cardamom and cinnamon into an ovenproof frying pan, about 20cm wide, and place over a high heat until bubbling. Shake the pan and stir the buttery sauce until it separates and the sugar caramelises to a toffee colour.Lay the pears in the pan, then cook in the sauce for 10-12 mins, tossing occasionally, until completely caramelised. Don’t worry about them burning – they won’t – but you want to caramelise them as much as possible. Splash in the brandy and let it flambé, then set the pears aside.Heat oven to 200C/fan 180C/gas 6. Roll the pastry out to the thickness of a £1 coin. Using a plate slightly larger than the top of the pan, cut out a circle, then press the edges of the circle of pastry to thin them out.When the pears have cooled slightly, arrange them in the pan, cut side up, in a floral shape, with the pears around the edge pointing inwards. Rest the cinnamon stick on the top in the centre, with the cardamom pods scattered around.Drape the pastry over the pears, then tuck the edges down the pan sides and under the fruit (see Gordon’s guide). Pierce the pastry a few times, then bake for 15 mins. If a lot of juice bubbles up the side of the pan, pour it off at this stage (see guide). Reduce oven to 180C/fan 160C/gas 4 and bake for 15 mins more until the pastry is golden. Leave the tart to stand for 10 mins, then invert it carefully onto a serving dish.Use a ripe, yet firm, pear that holds its shape.\r\nMy favourite pear for this dish is Comice as it’s\r\nnaturally firm-fleshed even when ripe, and has\r\na nice, round-bottomed shape.\r\nIn my restaurants we peel the pears and leave\r\nthem, uncovered, in the fridge for a day. This helps\r\nthem dry out, so they won’t release too much\r\njuice and dilute the caramel when you cook them.\r\nDon’t worry about them going brown as this\r\nactually adds to the finished dish.To make this into an apple Tatin, simply swap\r\nthe pears for apples. Tatins can also be made\r\nwith plums, nectarines or peaches, but won’t\r\nwork with fruits like strawberries or\r\nraspberries as their flesh is too soft.We pour away the excess juices from the pan\r\nhalfway through baking to stop the pastry\r\nbecoming soggy when you turn the tart out.\r\nThis isn’t essential but, if you do decide to do\r\nso, be very careful to avoid burning yourself\r\nwith the hot pan or the molten sauce.\r\nWe also serve baby tartes in my restaurants,\r\ncooking them to order in small copper pans.Make sure you tuck the pastry down the sides of\r\nthe pan, using a spoon or knife to lift the pears\r\nand tuck the pastry under. This will ensure the\r\npastry 'hugs' the fruit as it cooks, keeping the tart\r\nnice and compact.Use your gift card to cook our incredible Antipasti Pasta recipe!",

Make a well, pour in 200ml warm water and the olive oil and bring together with a wooden spoon until you have a soft, fairly wet dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 mins until smooth. Cover with a tea towel and set aside. You can leave the dough to rise if you like, but it’s not essential for a thin crust.Make the sauce: Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together, then season to taste. Leave to stand at room temperature while you get on with shaping the base.Roll out the dough: if you’ve let the dough rise, give it a quick knead, then split into two balls. On a floured surface, roll out the dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling pin. The dough needs to be very thin as it will rise in the oven. Lift the rounds onto two floured baking sheets.Top and bake: heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8. Put another baking sheet or an upturned baking tray in the oven on the top shelf. Smooth sauce over bases with the back of a spoon. Scatter with cheese and tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil and season. Put one pizza, still on its baking sheet, on top of the preheated sheet or tray. Bake for 8-10 mins until crisp. Serve with a little more olive oil, and basil leaves if using. Repeat step for remaining pizza.If the dough is too wet: add a bit more flour and work it in. If dough is too stretchy to roll out: leave it to rest for 10 mins or so, then try again. You need far more pressure when rolling dough than when rolling out pastry. If the base isn’t cooked: baking the pizza on top of a preheated sheet or tray should prevent this. However, it could be too thick or have too much topping. If the topping is cooked before the base, cover with foil and give it another 5 mins.Fancy a bit more topping? Here's some suggestions. Olives, ham and chargrilled artichokes; Spicy sausage, chilli or jalapeños andsliced tomato; Spinach, garlic, gorgonzola cheese and a whole egg cracked on top; Creamy mascarpone, pesto, roasted red peppers and sliced mushrooms. Or if you're not sure what you fancy – why not do half and half?Pile sauce and toppings onto one half of the dough circle, brush the edge with a little water, then fold and pinch to make a pasty shape. Bake until golden as before.Leave the dough a bit thicker, brush with oil and stud with rosemary sprigs. Bake for 15 mins or until risen and golden.

Slowly add around 150ml very cold water, or just enough so that you have a soft dough that picks up all the crumbs from the outside of the bowl, but isn’t too sticky to handle.Wrap the dough in cling film and chill while you coarsely grate the butter. Roll the dough out onto a floured work surface to a 30 x 40cm rectangle, then sprinkle the surface with half the grated butter to form an even layer. Don’t worry if the butter clumps together, just make sure the pieces are evenly distributed. With the shorter edge facing you, fold the top third of the dough towards you to the centre and the bottom third up over it. Give the dough a quarter turn, then roll out to the same size as before, sprinkle with the rest of the butter and repeat. Wrap the dough tightly in cling film and chill for 30 mins while you make the filling.Put the egg yolks and cornflour in a large heatproof mixing bowl and whisk in the sugar until pale and thick. Split the vanilla pod in half along the length and scrape out the seeds. Put the seeds in a medium-sized saucepan, along with the empty pod, the cinnamon stick and the lemon zest. Pour the milk and cream over the aromatics, stir and heat very gently until only just simmering. Pour the hot mixture over the egg yolks and whisk well. Pour the custard back into the pan and warm through for 2-3 mins or until thickened slightly to a consistency similar to double cream. Strain the custard through a sieve into a large jug and set aside, covered with cling film.Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Grease a 12-hole muffin tin with butter. Take your pastry out of the fridge and roll it flat to 40 x 20cm. Starting at the longest side, roll it up tightly to make a long roll of pastry. Trim the ends, then cut into 12 pieces, and turn them cut-side up on the work surface, so the spiral is facing upwards. Carefully flatten them out until they are big enough to line the holes in the muffin tin, trying not to skew the spiral shape too much. Press into the tins, then carefully pour in the custard mixture, filling each tart almost to the top.Bake for 30 mins or until the pastry is cooked through and the custard is just starting to puff up but not balloon.Remove from the oven and allow them to cool and sink gently back into shape.

To make the profiteroles, put the butter and 2 tsp of the caster sugar in a saucepan with 150ml water. Place the pan over a low heat until the butter and sugar have melted, then bring to the boil. Take off the heat, add the flour all at once and beat energetically with a wooden spoon until the dough comes away from the sides of the pan.Leave to cool for 5 mins, then beat in the eggs bit by bit until you have a stiff, glossy mixture (this process is much easier in a food processor). Rinse two baking trays with cold water, shaking off any excess so they are slightly damp (this helps the pastry to rise). Using 2 teaspoons, spoon blobs of the mixture onto the baking trays. Then place in the oven and cook for about 18-20 mins until well risen and brown. Remove the profiteroles from the oven and cut a small slit in the base of each one so they don’t collapse. Cool on a wire rack.When they’re cold, whip the cream lightly until just holding its shape. Sweeten to taste with remaining sugar and a few drops of vanilla extract. Cut the profiteroles in half, fill them with the sweetened cream and pile them up on a plate. You can refrigerate them for 1-2 hrs at this point but not for any longer as the pastry will go soggy.To make the sauce, sift the cocoa powder into a bowl.

Pumpkin can be steamed over a pan of boiling water or cooked in the microwaveTo steam the pumpkin, peel and seed it, then cut into evenly sized cubes. Put the cubes in a steamer or colander set over a pan of simmering water and cook for 10 mins. Test with the point of a knife and cook for a further 5 mins if not cooked through. Mash and leave to cool. Alternatively, to microwave the pumpkin, cut it in half (no need to peel it or cut out the seeds) and sit cut-side up in the microwave. Cook for 20 mins, then check the flesh is soft by poking it with a fork. Keep cooking if you’d like it softer. Scoop the flesh into a bowl, then mash and leave to cool.Different varieties of pumpkin make different purée textures and flavours, so while you can use any pumpkin for purée, they'll give different results. You can also try using different varieties of winter squash: butternut squash have orange flesh, a very dense texture and a sweet flavour, while kabocha (Japanese squash) have yellow flesh, an earthier flavour and turn fudgy once cooked. The orange pumpkins you see everywhere at Halloween usually don’t have much flavour and can have watery flesh.Use your gift card to cook our incredible Antipasti Pasta recipe!",

They're like a cheat’s version of naan bread, and are great for mopping up a curryCombine the flour, baking powder, yogurt and oil with 1 tsp salt and 2 tbsp water, and bring together into a rough dough. Tip onto a lightly floured surface and knead for a few minutes until slightly smooth, then divide into four to eight pieces, depending on the size of flatbread you want.Heat a heavy-based frying pan over a high heat. To make basic flatbreads, roll the dough pieces out on a lightly floured surface into rough ovals, then fry for 1-2 mins on each side until golden and slightly charred in spots. Alternatively, roll the dough pieces out, brush with a little melted ghee or butter, and scatter over the cumin seeds, garlic, coriander or chillies, if you like. Fold each piece of dough over on itself, then roll out again into a rough oval and cook in the same way.Brush the flatbreads with a little melted butter or ghee, then serve.Making a flatbread without yeast is super easy and saves time as you don’t have to wait hours for the dough to rise.This recipe uses baking powder as a speedy leavening agent that reacts with the natural yogurt to help the dough rise. It requires only a few minutes of kneading into a rough dough, before cooking in a frying pan over a high heat.You can make flatbreads using gluten-free flour but it will need more liquid. 300g of gluten-free flour will need around 250g of yogurt. It will change the texture slightly as gluten-free flour has a more powdery consistency but won’t change the flavour.Freezing flatbreads is easy – stack them and separate each flatbread with sheets of baking parchment so they don’t stick together. It’s important to cover them completely to avoid freezer burn.To re-heat rolled-out raw flatbreads, put them in a hot frying pan from frozen and fry on each side for 3-4 minutes. If you’ve frozen them cooked, splash them with a little water and put them in the microwave for 30 seconds or in a hot oven for around four minutes to defrost.They can be used like naans or pitta bread – serve with creamy chicken or veggie curries, kebabs and souvlaki.

Iced with buttercream and topped with coloured sprinkles, it's a cake that has the wow factorHeat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Butter and line three 20cm loose-bottomed sandwich cake tins with baking parchment.To make the sponge, beat the butter and sugar together in a stand mixer or using an electric whisk for 5-8 mins or until light and fluffy. Whisk in the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Fold in the flour, baking powder and milk to loosen. Divide the mixture between three mixing bowls, weighing for accuracy if you like. Colour one of the batters blue and another pink, starting with a little colouring, then adding more for a deeper finish. Leave one of the bowls of batter uncoloured.Get the three cake tins and bowls of batter ready in front of you. Spoon a heaped tablespoon of blue batter into the centre of the first tin, then pink in the second, and plain in the third. Working quickly so that it doesn’t spread too much, add another dollop of a different coloured batter on top of each one. Don’t wait for the batter to settle or spread, just keep alternating the colours until you run out. The weight of each layer will cause the batter to spread as you go, so very gently tap and shake the cake tins to even out the mixture, then bake in the centre of the oven for 25-30 mins or until firm to the touch. Turn out top-side down onto wire racks straightaway, then leave to cool completely.For the icing, put the butter, icing sugar and vanilla seeds into a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or put in a bowl and use an electric whisk. Beat for 5 mins or until fluffy and aerated. Add the cream cheese and beat briefly until just combined.Place one of the cakes on a cake stand or serving plate and spread 2 tbsp of the buttercream on top, then repeat with the other sponges. Spread a smooth layer of the icing over the top and sides of the cake, using a large palette knife, leaving some slightly less iced spots for a ‘naked’ finish.

        "description": "An easy, no-cook cheesecake that's dairy-free and gluten-free with just a little agave syrup to sweeten. This lusciously lemony vegan dessert will go down wonderfullyPut the cashews in a large bowl, pour over boiling water and leave to soak for 1 hr. Meanwhile, blitz the ingredients for the base with a pinch of salt in a food processor. Grease a 23cm tart tin with coconut oil, then press the mix into the base and pop in the fridge to set (about 30 mins).Drain the cashews and tip into the cleaned out food processor. Add all the remaining topping ingredients, reserving a quarter of the lemon zest in damp kitchen paper to serve, then blitz until smooth. Spoon onto the base and put in the fridge to set completely (about 2 hrs). Just before serving, scatter over the reserved lemon zest.Vegan cheesecake is made using cashew nuts, vegan cream cheese that is readily available in supermarkets, coconut oil and dates. We use dates as they add a sweetness to the base and cashews because once blended, they give a delicious creamy texture. If you’re looking for a good dairy-free cream cheese, read our review for the best vegan cheese.It’s essential to soak the cashews as it drastically softens them, making them a better texture to blitz into a smooth paste, rather than being left with a cashew crumb. Luckily because cashews don’t have a thick outer skin, they only take around 1 hour to soften.Chilling will help the cheesecake to stay together and set throughout, so we advise chilling it for at least 2 hours. You can always get ahead and make it the day before and leave it in the fridge overnight.Use your gift card to cook our incredible Antipasti Pasta recipe!",

Serve with clotted cream for an enjoyable afternoon tea in the gardenMix the flour, custard powder, ¼ tsp fine salt, the baking powder and sugar together in a large bowl. Rub the butter into the dry ingredients using your fingertips until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs.Gradually mix in the milk using your hands until you have a smooth dough – you may not need it all. Gently roll the dough out on a lightly floured surface to a 2cm thickness. Transfer to a baking tray lined with baking parchment, cover and chill for 30 mins to firm up, or up to 1 hr if you want to get ahead.Meanwhile, make the rhubarb compote. Tip all the ingredients into a large saucepan along with 2 tbsp water (omit the water if you’re using frozen rhubarb). Simmer over a medium heat for 10-15 mins, stirring occasionally until the rhubarb has softened and is almost collapsing, and the mixture has thickened. If you’re using frozen rhubarb, you may like to stir in a drop of red food colouring to enhance the pink colour. Transfer the compote to a bowl and leave to cool completely.Heat the oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7 and remove the dough from the fridge. Line a baking tray with baking parchment. Stamp out three or four scones from the dough using a 7cm round biscuit cutter (see tip below). Arrange the scones on the prepared tray, leaving a 2cm gap between each.Roll the remaining dough out again as in step two, then stamp out as many scones as you can (you should get about six in total). Transfer these to the tray as well, then brush all the scones with the beaten egg (see tip below). Bake for 10-12 mins until the tops are golden brown, then leave to cool completely on the tray.

Try this recipe using a clever coating of a potato-style batter made with slightly overcooked potatoesThe day before, tip the potatoes into a large pan of salted water and simmer for 10 mins or until just tender. Drain the potatoes in a colander, reserving a little of the cooking water, and leave to cool.Now here’s the trick: choose the two chunks that are the most cooked and ready for mashing and push these through a potato ricer, then add a little of the cooking water to make a thick potato batter. Roll the cooled potatoes through the batter, then put on a tray lined with baking parchment and chill overnight.The next day, heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Take a large roasting tin and add a good splash of vegetable oil. Place in the oven and heat for a few minutes, then carefully add the potatoes to the hot fat and turn to coat. Lightly season with salt and roast, without turning, for 40 mins.Carefully turn over the potatoes and increase the heat to 220C/200C fan/gas 8. Continue to roast for a further 20 mins, turning again once, until beautifully crisp and golden all over.You can choose from a variety of oils to make perfectly crispy roast potatoes, including olive, coconut, rapeseed and sunflower oils. Butter and goose fat are also popular choices for cooking roasties.The best cooking oil depends to an extent on your desired outcome. When our cookery team tested various fats, they found that coconut oil results in the best crunch, since it helps the roasties brown quicker.But overall, they felt that cooking with goose fat produces the best flavour; it also doesn’t get absorbed as quickly, so you only need to use a little.Use your gift card to cook our incredible Antipasti Pasta recipe!",

        "description": "Our easy cookie dough mixture is totally safe to eat and can be made in minutes. Keep a batch in the fridge, eat it by the spoon, serve it with ice cream, or mould it, shape it and colour it with food dyeTo make sure your flour is sterile, you’ll need to heat it up before using it. Heat the oven to 200C/fan 180C/gas 4. Spread the flour out on a lined baking tray and bake for 5 mins, cool before using. The liner will help when you add the flour to your dough.Beat the butter and sugar together, preferably in a mixer. Add the vanilla, ½ tsp salt and the cooked flour, then mix until it looks like breadcrumbs. Keep mixing as you add the milk until it comes together to form a dough. Eat as it is, or try one of these flavourings:Salted caramel dough: Add 1 tbsp dulce de leche, ½ tsp salt and a handful of dark chocolate chips to the dough and mix well.S'more cookie dough: Add 1 tbsp chocolate hazelnut spread, 2 crumbled digestive biscuits, and some mini marshmallows.Apple & cinnamon dough: Add some little chunks of dried apple and a sprinkle of cinnamon sugar (1 tsp cinnamon mixed with 1 tbsp soft brown sugar).Peanut heaven dough: Add 1 tbsp peanut butter and a handful of sugar-coated chocolate peanuts.This recipe for cookie dough is safe to eat as it doesn’t contain egg, so the risk of salmonella food poisoning is reduced. In the recipe, we've compensated for the lack of eggs by using milk and more butter. Due to the fact flour is not usually treated to kill pathogens, you should heat-sterilise it yourself at home. Follow the instructions in step 1 of the recipe.The best thing about this cookie dough is that it’s easy to alter the flavour to suit your tastes. For a salted caramel cookie dough, simply add 1 tbsp dulce de leche and ½ tsp salt along with a handful of chopped dark chocolate to the dough. For a s’mores cookie dough, add 1 tbsp hazelnut spread, some crumbled biscuits and mini marshmallows. Apple and cinnamon is also a delicious flavour combination for cookie dough. We'd also suggest making chocolate cookie dough by added 1 tbsp cocoa powder to the mix.Due to the high sugar content in the dough, it will last for up to four days.Yes. Simply roll the cookie dough into balls the size you’d like and arrange on a baking tray lined with baking parchment, well spaced apart. Cover freeze until completely solid. Once they’ve frozen, tip into a freezer bag and return to the freezer for up to three months.We couldn’t recommend baking this dough, although it is safe to do so. As it doesn’t have any eggs or leavening agent, the dough will spread. If you are looking for a baked cookie recipe, we recommend trying these basic cookies. If you were to bake off this cookie dough, we would suggest either crumbling it over ice cream or poached fruit as it may spread too much for cookies.Yes. We'd suggest freezing the cookie dough first and chopping it into small pieces or shaping into tiny balls and freezing those. Then, mix the dough pieces through your crème anglaise before churning it. Make sure your ice cream base mixture is cold, as it will melt the butter in the cookie dough otherwise – you’ll lose the shape of the dough and the chocolate will melt. Adding slightly less milk to the cookie dough mixture will also make it easier to shape into balls that will hold their shape while in the ice cream.The cookie dough is also delicious in other desserts. You could put it into the base of a chocolate trifle or use it in an ice cream terrine.Use your gift card to cook our incredible Antipasti Pasta recipe!",

Tablet is similar to fudge, but with a more crumbly texture.Line a 22 x 18cm tray with baking parchment. Put the butter and 150ml water in a pan over a low heat, and melt the butter (don't let the water boil). Tip in the sugar and dissolve, stirring often.Bring the water to the boil, turn down to a simmer, then add the condensed milk. The mixture will be a light creamy colour.Cook for 20-30 mins, stirring often, until the mixture is thick and a deep caramel colour.To test, drop a little mixture onto a cold side plate, it should not run and should be thick and sticky after 30 seconds. Remove from the heat and beat for 10-15 mins until it has slightly thickened. Pour into the prepared tin and leave to cool for 30 mins before cutting into squares.Luckily with this recipe, you don’t need a sugar thermometer as at each stage, it tells you exactly what you’re looking for before continuing on to the next instruction. If you wanted to be precise and have a sugar thermometer to hand, this will help. You’re looking for it to reach soft ball stage which is around 120C and then when beating it until it’s just beginning to set.A Scottish tablet has a gritty, melt-in-the mouth texture that is incredibly sweet but irresistible, unlike fudge which although visually similar, has a softer texture.We recommend cooking your tablet for 20-30 mins over a medium heat, however it will depend on the size of your pan, the thickness of it and the intensity of the heat. It could take anywhere up to 45 mins for it to be at the right temperature/colour so make sure you keep an eye on it and only take it off when it either reaches 120C or has turned a deep caramel colour.Use your gift card to cook our incredible Antipasti Pasta recipe!",

Chop the slender end into 2cm cubes, toss in half the oil, season lightly and roast in the oven, stirring occasionally, until golden brown on the outside and soft in the centre, about 30 mins. Cut the bulb in half and scrape out the seeds with a spoon – you can keep these to toast in the oven and sprinkle over salads. Chop the flesh into 2cm pieces. Warm the vegetable stock in a small pan, set over a low heat. Drop in squash and leave to gently poach.While the squash is roasting, warm a medium-size frying pan over a gentle heat. Add the remaining olive oil and half the butter, followed by the onion. Cover and cook for 3 mins until the onion turns translucent. Stir in the celery, garlic, herbs and a few turns of pepper (no salt at this stage). Cover again and cook for a further 2 mins. Increase the heat slightly and stir in the rice.

        "description": "Struggle to make perfect soft-boiled eggs with a runny centre? Just follow our foolproof recipe, then serve with toast soldiers or in a salad niçoiseFill a medium sized saucepan with water and bring to a rolling boil.Make sure your eggs aren't fridge cold. By having the eggs at room temperature, it will be less of a shock for the egg reaching the hot water and therefore less likely to crack. You can also use an egg pricker to make a very small hole in each egg before boiling, which will also reduce the chances of it cracking in the heat. Slowly lower the eggs into the water using a spoon.Set your timer for 4-5 mins for runny/dippy eggs to serve with soldiers, or 6-7 mins for soft-boiled eggs for a salad. If serving in a salad, plunge the eggs into a bowl of cold water as soon as the timer goes off – this will stop them cooking and cool the shells quickly for peeling.How long an egg takes to boil depends entirely on how runny you'd like the yolk and white to be. Eggs used to be boiled until they were completely cooked for use in sandwiches and salads, but now they are often cooked until the white is just set and yolk is ‘jammy’. This means the yolk is still slightly soft and hasn’t turned hard and chalky. Eggs with this kind of centre are also prized for the centres of scotch eggs.There is no absolute foolproof way to perfectly boil an egg as, each time, the size and temperature of the egg may vary. You can also start by cooking in cold water or add the eggs to boiling water. Because eggs cook from the outside in, the whites are liable to overcooking. However, with a bit of trial and error, you can find the method that suits you.To boil an egg accurately, make sure it is not fridge-cold and use a timing suitable for the size. The timings below are for large eggs – cook for 30 seconds less for a medium egg and 30 seconds more for an extra-large egg.To cook from boiling:Make sure your eggs aren’t fridge-cold (if your eggs are fridge-cold, add 30 seconds to each timing below) – eggs at room temperature will have less of a shock when put into hot water and will therefore be less likely to crack.You can also use an egg pricker or pin to make a very small hole in each egg before boiling, which will reduce the chance of it cracking in the heat. Slowly lower the eggs into the water using a spoon – don’t just drop them.Bring a large pan of water to the boil and lower in the eggs in a single layer. Reduce the heat to a simmer and use the following timings for large eggs:When done, scoop the eggs out of the pan using a slotted spoon and put them into a bowl of very cold water to prevent them cooking any further.Cooking from cold and leaving to restPut the eggs in a single layer in a pan and cover them with room-temperature water so it comes about 1cm above the eggs. Cover and bring it to the boil. When the water is boiling, reduce the heat to a simmer and start timing.For fully hard-boiled eggs, you can also turn the heat off as soon as the water boils and leave the eggs in the water for 12 mins.When done, scoop the eggs out of the pan using a slotted spoon and put them into a bowl of very cold water to prevent them cooking any further.If you’re using a gas hob, you may find that your eggs cook a little quicker as the heat can be fierce, so cook the eggs for 4 minutes for a runny egg or 6 minutes for soft-boiled. For induction hobs, the eggs can take about 1 minute more, so 5 minutes for runny and 7 minutes for soft-boiled.Use your gift card to cook our incredible Antipasti Pasta recipe!",

        "title": "How to make sourdough bread",
        "description": "Make a sourdough starter from scratch, then use it to bake a flavoursome loaf of bread with our simple step-by-step recipe.First, make your starter. In a large bowl, mix together 100g of the flour with 125ml slightly warm water. Whisk together until smooth and lump-free.Transfer the starter to a large jar (a 1-litre Kilner jar is good) or a plastic container. Leave the jar or container lid ajar for 1 hr or so in a warm place (around 25C is ideal), then seal and set aside for 24 hrs.For the next 6 days, you will need to ‘feed’ the starter. Each day, tip away half of the original starter, add an extra 100g of flour and 125ml slightly warm water, and stir well. Try to do this at the same time every day.After 3-4 days you should start to see bubbles appearing on the surface, and it will smell yeasty and a little acidic. This is a good indicator that the starter is working.On day 7, the starter should be quite bubbly and smell much sweeter. It is now ready to be used in baking.Tip the flour, 225ml warm water, the salt, honey and the starter into a bowl, or a mixer fitted with a dough hook. Stir with a wooden spoon, or on a slow setting in the machine, until combined – add extra flour if it’s too sticky or a little extra warm water if it’s too dry.Tip onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 10 mins until soft and elastic – you should be able to stretch it without it tearing. If you‘re using a mixer, turn up the speed a little and mix for 5 mins.Place the dough in a large, well-oiled bowl and cover. Leave in a warm place to rise for 3 hrs. You may not see much movement, but don’t be disheartened, as sourdough takes much longer to rise than a conventional yeasted bread.Line a medium-sized bowl with a clean tea towel and flour it really well or, if you have a proving basket, you can use this (see tips below). Tip the dough back onto your work surface and knead briefly to knock out any air bubbles. Shape the dough into a smooth ball and dust it with flour.Place the dough, seam-side up, in the bowl or proving basket, cover loosely and leave at room temperature until roughly doubled in size. The time it takes for your bread to rise will vary depending on the strength of your starter and the temperature in the room, anywhere from 4-8 hrs. The best indicators are your eyes, so don’t worry too much about timings here. You can also prove your bread overnight in the fridge. Remove it in the morning and let it continue rising for another hour or 2 at room temperature. The slower the rise, the deeper the flavour you will achieve.Place a large baking tray in the oven, and heat to 230C/210C fan/gas 8. Fill a small roasting tin with a little water and place this in the bottom of the oven to create steam. Remove the baking tray from the oven, sprinkle with flour, then carefully tip the risen dough onto the tray.Slash the top a few times with a sharp knife, if you like, then bake for 35-40 mins until golden brown. It will sound hollow when tapped on the bottom. Leave to cool on a wire rack for 20 mins before serving.The dough will rise perfectly well in a bowl, but for the distinctive outline on the side of your loaf, use a proving basket (also called a banneton). Usually made from natural cane woven in a spiral pattern, they come in oval or round shapes. Make sure that you flour the basket really well before using, pushing flour into all the grooves, and never wash it – simply tap out the old flour after every use.

Enjoy a golden brown slice drizzled with olive oilMake sure your starter is active – it should be nice and bubbly. If it isn’t, feed it and wait until a teaspoon of the starter floats in warm water. When you’re happy your starter is active, measure 100g into a large bowl and pour over 400ml tepid water. Stir with a rubber spatula to combine, but don’t worry if there are unmixed bits of starter. Tip in the flour and mix everything together to make a rough dough. Make sure all the flour is mixed in and that there are no dry bits up the side of the bowl. Cover and leave to rest for at least 30 mins or up to 1 hr.Prepare a jug of water for dipping your hands into. Scatter 10g salt over the dough, dip a hand into the water and scrunch it through the dough to mix in the salt. The dough should come back together and the salt should be completely mixed in.

Make sure all the flour is incorporated and leave, semi-uncovered, at room temperature for another 24 hrs.Day 4:You should start to see some activity in the mixture now; there should be some bubbles forming and bubbling on top. Mix 50g flour with 50g tepid water and stir into yesterday’s mixture. Make sure all the flour is incorporated and leave, semi-uncovered, at room temperature for another 24 hrs.Day 5:The mixture should be very active now and ready for making your levain (starter). If it’s not bubbling, continue to feed it on a daily basis until it does. When it’s ready, it should smell like yogurt.You now have a starter, which is the base to the bread. You’ll need to look after it, but naming is optional! Keep it in the fridge (it will stay dormant) and 24 hrs before you want to use it, pour half of it off and feed it with 100g flour and 100g water. Leave it at room temperature and it should become active again. The longer the starter has been dormant, the more times it will need to be refreshed – the process of pouring off half the starter and replacing it with new flour and water – to reactivate.

Remove any string from the chicken and sit in a large roasting tin or a baking dish, with plenty of space around it.Mash 2 tbsp of the mascarpone with the lemon zest, 1 tbsp of the tarragon and some seasoning. Slip your hand beneath the chicken skin to pull it away from the meat, then spread the mixture beneath the skin in a thin layer. Spoon another 3 tbsp mascarpone into the cavity of the chicken, to melt in with the roasting juices and enrich the sauce later on. Rub 2 tbsp olive oil into the skin, season well with sea salt, then loosely tie the legs together with butcher’s string. Roast for 20 mins. Aarrange the potatoes and the garlic around the chicken, drizzle over another 1 tbsp oil and cook for another 30 mins.Toss the radishes and whole spring onions into the dish, in and around the potatoes, coating everything in the fat, then roast for another 25 mins. The potatoes and radishes will be golden and tender, and the chicken should be cooked through. Remove the chicken from the tin, cover loosely with foil and leave to rest.Pour off or spoon away the excess oil from the tin. Stir the remaining mascarpone (about 150g) with the stock in a jug until lump-free, then pour into the tin and bubble on the hob for few minutes, stirring to coat the potatoes and veg. Squeeze over some lemon juice and season. Stir in the peas, spring greens and most of the remaining tarragon, and bubble for a few more minutes until bright green. Sit the chicken back in the middle of the tin to serve and scatter over the reserved tarragon.Swap radishes for chopped leeks, long-stem broccoli, sugar snaps or mangetout.Tarragon, with its sweet aniseed flavour, complements the flavour of chicken and cuts through the creaminess of the sauce. If you’re not a fan of aniseed (it tastes more like fennel than liquorice), basil, chives or even wild garlic would work equally well.Squeeze the garlic from its skin and mash to a paste. Mix with mayonnaise and some lemon juice. Use for drizzling over any leftover roast chicken.Tip any leftover vegetables and pan juices into a bowl and mix with beaten eggs.

Snap or carefully chop the stalks off the ends of the green beans. Cut any thick stems of broccoli in half lengthways. Cut the root ends and about 2cm off the green tops of the spring onions, then cut each onion into 3 batons.Fill a large saucepan halfway with water, put it on the hob and turn the heat on to medium-high until the water boils. Carefully tip the prepared vegetables into the pan of boiling water and simmer for 1 min. Put a colander in the sink and carefully tip the veggies and water into it.Find a large baking tray (ours was 30cm x 40cm). Tip the cooked veggies into the tray and drizzle with 2 tsp olive oil.

Pick the coriander leaves and scatter these over the salmon and veg. Serve with cooked noodles or rice.No bones about itMost fish fillets come without any bones, but it’s a good idea to check that none have been left in as they’re sharp, pointy and unpleasant to eat! To check the salmon doesn’t have any bones, stroke your finger across the pink side of the salmon (not the skin) – if you feel any sharp, needle-like bones poking out, pull them out with a pair of kitchen tweezers, or simply pinch the bone between your fingers and quickly pull upwards.Use your gift card to cook our incredible Antipasti Pasta recipe!",

Butter and line a 900g loaf tin with a strip of baking parchment.Beat the butter and both sugars in a bowl for 5 mins with an electric whisk until really fluffy. Whisk the eggs, banana and yogurt in a separate bowl until mostly smooth, then whisk this into the butter and sugar mixture. Fold in the flour and baking powder until just combined, then fold in the dates and nuts. Spoon into the tin, smooth over the top and bake for 1 hr-1 hr 15 mins until a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean. Leave to cool in the tin for 10 mins, then lift out using the strip of parchment. You can serve it warm now, or leave to cool completely on a wire rack. Will keep for four days in an airtight container.Meanwhile, make the toffee sauce. Put the sugar in a heavy-based frying pan and melt over a medium-low heat until light golden brown and liquid – don’t stir, just tilt the pan to melt the sugar. Carefully whisk in the butter until smooth, then pour in the cream slowly and bring to a bubble. Mix until the sauce is smooth and shiny. Pour into a heatproof bowl, cover and leave to cool to room temperature.For the brittle, put the sugar in a frying pan with 2 tbsp water over a medium heat, stir briefly, then simmer for 10 mins until the caramel turns amber. Don’t stir after the initial mix, just tilt the pan to get an even deep golden colour.Meanwhile, line a baking tray with baking parchment. Carefully stir the nuts, banana chips and salt into the caramel, until well coated, then pour onto the tray. Tip the tray (or use a spoon) to make sure the nuts are in a single layer – or they will be harder to separate later. Leave to cool completely before breaking the brittle into shards.Stir the toffee sauce to loosen if it’s become stiff, or warm for a few seconds in the microwave (add a splash more cream if you need to), then drizzle over the cake so it drips down the sides. Top with the shards of brittle. Will keep for two days in an airtight container.Mixed nuts are the cheapest nuts to buy, but use whatever you have – just check the use-by date as they go rancid quite quickly. Hazelnuts, walnuts, almonds or peanuts all work well in this cake.A simple toffee sauce and brittle add extra flavour and texture to the cake using everyday, storecupboard ingredients.Banana bread keeps well in the freezer.

Our recipe delivers on expectations, with a lovely sticky sponge, true toffee flavour and a light spongeButter a medium rectangular baking tin (roughly 30 x 20cm, and at least 5cm deep) and line with baking parchment. Tip the dates into a heatproof bowl with the bicarb and vanilla, then pour over the rum, if using, and 200ml kettle-hot water. (If omitting the rum, use 300ml water.) Leave to soak for 30 mins. Meanwhile, toast the pecans in a dry pan over a medium heat for 6-8 mins until nutty and starting to brown a little. Remove from the heat and set aside.Heat the oven to 190C/170C fan/gas 5. Tip the dates and their soaking liquid into a food processor and pulse until roughly chopped. Tip half back into the bowl, then blitz the rest to a smooth purée. Pour this over the roughly chopped dates in the bowl.Tip the butter and sugar into a bowl and beat using an electric whisk or for 3-5 mins until fluffy. Or, do this in a stand mixer. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, then fold through the flour, spices and a large pinch of salt. The batter will be thick. Fold through the date mixture and pecans, then scrape everything into the prepared tin. Level the surface with a spatula and bake for 30-35 mins until just set and a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean.While the pudding bakes, make the sauce. Tip the sugar, butter and treacle into a saucepan and warm over a medium heat, stirring continuously until the sugar has dissolved and the butter has melted. Bubble for 3 mins until the mixture is thick. Stir in the cream and simmer, stirring, for 2 mins until you have a dark toffee sauce. About 10 mins before the end of the pudding cooking time, remove it from the oven, drizzle half the sauce over and spread out with a spatula to cover.

        "title": "Strawberry cheesecake in 4 easy steps",
        "description": "Follow our step-by-step recipe for this easy no-cook cheesecake – a delicious summer dessert for all occasionsTo make the base, butter and line a 23cm loose-bottomed tin with baking parchment. Put the digestive biscuits in a plastic food bag and crush to crumbs using a rolling pin. Transfer the crumbs to a bowl, then pour over the melted butter. Mix thoroughly until the crumbs are completely coated. Tip them into the prepared tin and press firmly down into the base to create an even layer. Chill in the fridge for 1 hr to set firmly.For more detail on how to make a biscuit base, take a look at our how to make a biscuit base video.Slice the vanilla pod in half lengthways, leaving the tip intact, so that the two halves are still joined. Holding onto the tip of the pod, scrape out the seeds using the back of a kitchen knife.Pour the double cream into a bowl and whisk with an electric mixer until it’s just starting to thicken to soft peaks. Place the soft cheese, icing sugar and the vanilla seeds in a separate bowl, then beat for 2 mins with an electric mixer until smooth and starting to thicken, it will get thin and then start to thicken again. Tip in the double cream and fold it into the soft cheese mix. You’re looking for it to be thickened enough to hold its shape when you tip a spoon of it upside down. If it’s not thick enough, continue to whisk. Spoon onto the biscuit base, starting from the edges and working inwards, making sure that there are no air bubbles. Smooth the top of the cheesecake down with the back of a dessert spoon or spatula. Leave to set in the fridge overnight.Bring the cheesecake to room temperature about 30 mins before serving. To remove it from the tin, place the base on top of a can, then gradually pull the sides of the tin down. Slip the cake onto a serving plate, removing the lining paper and base. Purée half the strawberries in a blender or food processor with the icing sugar and 1 tsp water, then sieve. Pile the remaining strawberries onto the cake, and pour the purée over the top.To ensure the basesets properly, the melted butter must bethoroughly mixed through the biscuitcrumbs. Make sure you also leave it inthe fridge to firm up for at least 1 hr beforeadding the filling so that the crumbs donot mix into the soft cheese mixture.The cheesecakemay have needed more time in the fridge.The mixture should be quite firmto begin with, but a long chilling time(preferably overnight) is essential toensure the filling sets well.Lemon: Beat the finely grated zest & juice 2 lemons with the soft cheese & icing sugar instead of the vanilla seeds. Top with lemon curd & leave to chill. Raspberry: Replace strawberries with fresh raspberries. Passion fruit & mango: Make a delicious sauce by sieving the pulp of 4 passion fruit and sweetening to taste with a little icing sugar. Top the cheesecake with chopped mango, then pour over the sauce, dotting the top with a few of the passion fruit seeds.If you find the cake difficult to un-mould, either let it sit for a little longer or wipe the outside of the tin with a warm cloth. This heats the edges and should allow you to remove the tin easily.Try plenty of indulgent cheesecake ideas from our sister title olivemagazine.com/cheesecakes.Use your gift card to cook our incredible Antipasti Pasta recipe!",

It’s also important to get children into the habit of washing their hands frequently after touching uncooked meat and fish.As well as being a smart way of presenting food, making foil parcels is a great way to cook with kids, as most of the recipe is prepared away from the heat and there aren’t any flames to contend with.

Pick the coriander leaves off the stalks, finely chop the stalks and put the leaves in a bowl. Grate the zest of one of the limes. Set aside. Pour both cans of coconut milk into a large jug, then fill one of the empty cans with cold water and stir this into the jug.Heat the oil and butter in the pan over a lowish heat, tip in the shallots and sizzle gently for about 5 minutes, stirring, until they start to turn golden. Stir the curry paste in and cook for another minute.Take the pan off the heat and add the lime zest, coriander stalks, rice and a heaped teaspoon of salt, then mix everything together until the rice is coated in the curry paste. (You can prepare this up to two hours ahead.)Pour the coconut milk mixture over the rice and stir. Bring to simmering point on a medium heat, stirring gently now and then. Get the spoon right to the bottom of the pan so the rice doesn’t stick to it. Scatter in the lime leaves and leave everything to simmer, uncovered, for 5 minutes.Stir the rice once more, then lay the salmon fillets on top. Cover and leave to barely simmer over a very low heat for 15-20 minutes until the salmon looks cooked and the rice is tender. Cook everything very gently or you will have crunchy rice on the bottom and no liquid left.While the fish is cooking, juice two of the limes (the grated lime and another) and in a small bowl mix the juice with the soy sauce and sugar until the sugar has dissolved. Trim the spring onions, then split lengthways and slice into thin strands on the diagonal. Mix the spring onions and chilli with the coriander leaves. Cut the third lime into six wedges.When the rice and fish are ready, take the pan off the heat and leave to stand for 5 minutes. To serve, scatter a third of the coriander salad over everything in the pan. Spoon some coconut rice on each plate, then, using a fish slice, put a salmon portion on top. Drizzle with some of the soy and lime dressing and scatter a spoonful of the coriander salad on top. Give everyone a lime wedge to squeeze over it.

Lightly oil and line the base and sides of a 20cm square cake tin.Put the egg whites in a large bowl with a pinch of salt. Beat with an electric hand whisk until foamy, about 3 mins. Keep mixing while you add 150g of the sugar, a spoonful at a time, until thick and glossy.In another bowl, mix the egg yolks, remaining sugar and vanilla (no need to clean the beaters first) for 2 mins, or until pale and foamy. Add the flour, baking powder and milk to the egg yolks, and use a spatula to fold everything together.Add a large spoonful of egg white to the cake mix, beat together to loosen the mixture, then gently fold through the remaining egg whites with a large metal spoon (being careful not to over-stir so you don’t knock out too much air), until you have a smooth batter.Pour into the tin, smooth the top and bake for 40-45 mins until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Mix together the evaporated milk, condensed milk and 3 tbsp of the cream.Leave the cake to cool for 10 mins in the tin, then ease a knife around the sides. Poke holes over the surface with a skewer, then pour over half the milk mixture. After 5 mins or so, most of it should have soaked into the cake.

This biscuit dough is extremely forgiving if overworked, so it's perfect for baking with childrenHeat the butter, syrup and sugar together in a small pan until melted, stirring occasionally. Set aside to cool slightly.Mix together the bicarb, ginger, cinnamon and flour in a large bowl. Pour in the buttery syrup mixture and stir to combine, then use your hands to bring together to form a dough. Add up to 1 tbsp of milk to combine if needed. The dough will be soft at this point, but it’ll firm up in the fridge.Put the dough on a sheet of baking parchment, shape into a rectangle, and lay another sheet of parchment on top of it. Roll the dough out to a thickness of ½cm. Transfer to a baking sheet to keep it flat, leaving the parchment in place, then chill in the fridge for 1 hr.Heat the oven to 190C/170C fan/gas 5 and line a large baking sheet with more baking parchment. Remove the dough from the fridge and cut out shapes using a cookie cutter. We used 9cm stars, but you can choose any shape. We also made some with smaller stars cut out of the centre to thread ribbon through and hang from a Christmas tree.Place the shapes, spread apart, on the lined baking sheet, and bake for 10-12 mins. (Depending on the size of the cutters you use, they might need a few minutes more or less cooking in the oven). Leave to cool completely on the baking sheet.Meanwhile, mix the icing sugar with 1-2 tbsp water – you want to create a consistency that’s thick and pipeable, and not too thin or it will run.

Tip the flour into a mixing bowl with the salt. Shoot in the butter, then rub together with your fingers to make a reasonably fine crumbed mixture, lifting to aerate the mixture as you go. Try not to overrub, as the mixture will be lighter if it’s a little bit flaky. Now stir in the sugar.Measure the buttermilk, then mix in the milk to slacken it. Make a bit of a well in the middle of the flour mixture with a round-bladed knife, then pour in most of this buttermilk mixture, holding a little bit back in case it’s not needed. Using the knife, gently work the mixture together until it forms a soft, almost sticky, dough. Work in any loose dry bits of mixture with the rest of the buttermilk. Don’t overwork at this point or you will toughen the dough.Lift the ball of soft dough out of the bowl and put it on to a very lightly floured surface. Knead the mixture just 3-4 times to get rid of the cracks.Pat the dough gently with your hands to a thickness of no less than 2cm and no more than 2.5cm. Dip a 5.5cm round fluted cutter into a bowl of flour – this helps to stop the dough sticking to it, then cut out the scones by pushing down quickly and firmly on the cutter with the palm of your hand – don’t twist it.You will hear the dough give a big sigh as the cutter goes in. Gather the trimmings lightly then pat and cut out a couple more scones.Place on the baking sheet and sift over a light dusting of flour or glaze if you wish. Bake for 10-12 minutes until risen and golden.

It's the perfect partner to all your favourite meat-free trimmings at the festive tableHeat the oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Tip the portobello mushrooms, onions, carrots, celery and garlic into a roasting tin, toss in the sunflower oil, then spread out into a single layer. Roast for 40 mins, undisturbed – the veg should be very slightly charred.Drizzle over the agave, vinegar, tomato purée, soy and 2 tbsp water. Toss together until completely coated, then return to the oven for 5 mins until sticky and caramelised. Stir in the flour and dried mushrooms, and return to the oven for a final 10 mins.If the tin is flameproof, put on the hob over a low heat, stir in the port and cook until you have a thick paste mixed in with all the ingredients. Pour over two-thirds of the stock, add the herbs, bring to a boil and cook for 10 mins. If the tin isn’t flameproof, drizzle over the port, stir to loosen all the burnt bits, then tip everything into a pan and continue with the stock and herbs.Turn off the heat and mash everything with a potato masher to extract as much flavour as possible. Carefully pass the contents through a sieve set over another saucepan, pushing down to release all the liquid. Add the rest of the stock and simmer until the gravy is thickened and rich. Leave to cool. To serve, simply reheat. Will keep, chilled and covered for up to three days or frozen for up to two months.Passing your gravy through a fine sieve in the final step of our recipe will ensure your gravy is lump-free. Simmering will also ensure it reaches the desired thickness to give you a rich, smooth gravy once it has been passed through the sieve.You can make our recipe up to three days in advance – keep chilled and reheat to serve. It’s also freezable and can be stored in the freezer for up to two months.The port adds a depth and richness that really enhances the gravy, but you can replace it with red grape juice. As red grape juice is much sweeter than port, reduce the amount of agave syrup to 1 tbsp.Use any leftover gravy to add extra flavour to a vegan (or non-vegan) cottage pie, bolognese or stew. You can freeze any leftover gravy in an ice cube tray, then transfer the cubes to a freezer bag; this way you can just take out what you need.For an impressive vegan roast dinner, choose from our easy vegan wellington or vegan nut roast and some vegan stuffing, lemon, garlic & bay roast potatoes or thyme roasted vegetables on the side.Our vegan mushroom gravy uses mushrooms and miso paste for a deep, rich flavour and can also be made ahead and frozen.Use your gift card to cook our incredible Antipasti Pasta recipe!",

Knead some pink food colouring into one of them and keep the other plain. Wrap both types of dough in sheets of cling film and chill in the fridge for 20-30 mins.Roll the plain dough out onto a lightly floured surface until it’s about 25cm long and 20cm wide. Do the same with the pink dough and lay one on top of the other. Lightly roll over the surface once or twice with your rolling pin just to press them together. Trim off all the edges so they're straight then carefully roll them up from one of the short edges to make a tight spiral. Wrap tightly in cling film and chill for 1hr or overnight.Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and line 2 trays with baking parchment. Unwrap the dough, trim the end and cut the rest into 20 slices and lay them cut side down on your prepared baking tray. Bake for 15-17 mins or until ever so slightly golden at the very edges. Allow them to cool on the tray before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.Mix the icing sugar with enough lemon juice to make it the consistency of smooth peanut butter and pour the sprinkles into a shallow bowl or plate.

Add the vanilla extract and the egg whites, a little at a time, beating until fully combined before adding more. Mix together the flour, cornflour and baking powder. Add the dry ingredients in 3 additions, alternating with the buttermilk. Divide the batter between the tins and level the tops.Bake for 25-30 mins or until a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean. Allow the cakes to cool in the tins for 10 mins, then turn out onto a wire rack, peeling off the parchment. Cool completely.To make the buttercream, put the egg whites and sugar in a big bowl (the bowl of your tabletop mixer, if you have one) with the vanilla seeds and set over a pan of gently simmering water. Lightly whisk until the sugar has fully dissolved – you can test this by dipping two fingers into the bowl and rubbing them together; if you can’t feel any grains of sugar, the mixture is ready. Remove the bowl from the heat and keep whisking until a thick meringue has formed. Continue whisking until the meringue has cooled to room temperature, then slowly add in the butter, 1 tbsp at a time. By the time all the butter has been incorporated, the mixture should have transformed into a silky-smooth buttercream. If it hasn’t, continue to whisk until it does. If it still refuses to thicken, it may be the mixture is still too warm, so chill for 10 mins, then continue whisking. Add the vanilla extract and mix to combine.To assemble the cake, place a sponge on a cake board or serving plate and top with a thin layer of buttercream. Repeat with the remaining cake layers and finish by spreading the remaining buttercream over the top and sides of the cake (see below). To get a smooth finish, use the edge of a palette knife, and drag carefully around the sides of the cake, smoothing out the buttercream. To decorate the cake, press the sides of it with the edible polka dot sprinkles creating a full border at the bottom with less and less the further up the cake you go. Best served within 2 days of baking, but the cake will keep for up to 4 days.Crumb-coating is something that professional bakers do to give their cakes a polished finish. Spread a very thin layer of the icing over the whole cake first before icing properly. It helps to stick down any stray crumbs, so you shouldn’t get any in your final icing. For a really neat finish, chill the cake after crumb-coating (also known as masking) before continuing to ice.Use your gift card to cook our incredible Antipasti Pasta recipe!",

        "title": "Vegan paella",
        "description": "Achieve four of your 5-a-day with this vegan paella – it makes a satisfying yet low-calorie supper. We’ve included broad beans, a valuable source of plant proteinPut the kettle on to boil. Tip the saffron, tomato purée and bouillon powder into a large heatproof bowl, then pour over 1 litre boiling water and set aside.Heat the oil in a large paella pan or frying pan over a medium heat and fry the onion for 5 mins, stirring often until starting to soften. Add the peppers, garlic and thyme, and cook for a few minutes more. Tip in the rice and paprika, and continue to cook, stirring for about a minute. Pour in the saffron stock, then cover and simmer for 10 mins.Uncover and gently stir, then add the frozen beans and courgettes. Return to a simmer, then cover and cook for another 10 mins until the rice is tender and has absorbed the stock. Leave to stand for 5 mins, then stir in the parsley. Serve half the paella straightaway with lemon wedges for squeezing over. The other half will keep chilled for up to three days. To enjoy on another day, reheat in the microwave until piping hot throughout.This rice dish originates from Valencia, Spain and the name refers to the ‘paellera’ – the large, shallow frying pan – in which it is traditionally cooked. In Spain, it’s often cooked outdoors and eaten straight from the pan. Although it usually includes various combinations of seafood and chicken, you can also have vegetable paellas. Smoked paprika is an important ingredient in a vegan or vegetarian paella as it replaces the typical smoky flavour of chorizo in the classic version.Traditionally, vegetables such as green beans, peas, peppers and artichoke hearts are added to the base which comprises rice cooked in olive oil, stock and saffron. Onions and tomatoes are also commonly used as well as garlic for added flavour. In our take on the classic version, we’ve used onions and peppers but also added broad beans and courgettes to give it an extra-summery dimension.In a traditional paella you would use bomba rice. Sometimes recipes substitute arborio rice or other risotto rice, however in our vegan twist on the classic recipe we’re using brown basmati rice. This adds a slightly earthy, nutty flavour as well as making it a healthier choice, being richer in fibre.Saffron is the key ingredient for adding that bright golden colour. Saffron is an expensive and much-prized spice made from the dried stigmas of the crocus flower and it adds a slightly floral and earthy flavour to the dish. Mixing saffron with hot water before combining it with the other ingredients brings out the vibrant colour. A small amount of ground turmeric can be used as an inexpensive alternative.UK-grown rapeseed oil has been heralded as the British answer to olive oil, but its flavour is more earthy and nutty than it is fruity. If you prefer, you can use olive oil instead – it’s what the Spanish traditionally use.While purists insist on using a traditional flat-based paella pan, you can still make a delicious paella in a regular pan. Either use a large frying pan, or a wide, shallow-sided saucepan or casserole, with a flat bottom. It’s best to avoid non-stick pans if you can as these won’t give you the desirable crust on the bottom. But if that’s all you have, you’ll still have a winning dish. A regular, high-sided saucepan won’t work very well as you’re after a thin layer of rice and vegetables to create the best texture.It doesn’t need constant stirring – in fact, you should keep stirring to a minimum. The idea in a traditional paella is to create a crunchy, golden-brown layer of rice at the bottom of the pan known as ‘socarrat’ – it’s a much-valued part of paella in Spain although it can be a bit tricky to get right. When adding the broad beans and courgettes, stir them in gently and try not to disturb the bottom layer.This recipe does not freeze well. It will keep covered and chilled in the fridge for up to three days. To reheat, microwave until piping hot throughout.Have a look at our guide to the best paella pans.Our vegan recipe for artichoke & aubergine rice is very similar to paella and uses turmeric in place of saffron to give the distinctive yellow colour.Originally inspired by Spanish paella, our vegan jambalaya makes a delicious plant-based dinner.For an easy, fool-proof version, try our easiest ever paella using chorizo and frozen seafood for an authentic flavour.Our chicken chorizo paella combines chicken breast, chorizo and frozen peas to make a great family-friendly dinner.For an authentic taste of Spain, our next level paella uses an abundance of seafood.

However, if the mixture is too firm, use electric beaters to help lighten it and add 1-2 tbsp dairy-free milk when whisking.",

Scrape into the prepared tin, then use a spatula to evenly spread it and smooth the surface.

        "description": "Try sponge instead of fruit cake this Christmas. Our white chocolate cake is a crowd-pleaser and you can buy the meringue decorations, or bake them yourselfHeat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Rub a little butter over the base and sides of two 20cm cake tins (use cake tins rather than sandwich tins as the higher sides work better), then line the base and sides with baking parchment. Melt 150g butter with 100g of the chocolate in a bowl set over a small saucepan of gently simmering water – make sure the base of the bowl doesn’t touch the water. Stir the butter and chocolate every min or so until it has melted. Set aside to cool a little.Meanwhile, measure 250g flour, 2 tsp baking powder, ½ tsp bicarb and 250g sugar in a large bowl. Make a well in the middle and add 150g yogurt, 2 tsp vanilla extract, half the orange zest and juice, 3 eggs and 2 tbsp milk. Whisk everything together, then stir in the melted butter and chocolate.When the cake mixture is smooth (this makes a very wet pourable batter), divide it equally between the two cake tins. Bake on the middle shelf for 25-30 mins, they will look golden and evenly risen when cooked. Check they are done by pushing a skewer into the centre of the cakes – it should come out clean. If there is any wet cake mixture on the skewer, return the cake to the oven for a few more mins, then check again.Leave the cakes to cool in their tins for 5 mins, then transfer to a cooling rack. Wash out the tins and repeat steps 1 and 2, to make two more sponges in total. You can make them a day or two before icing, then wrap them in a double layer of cling film once cool. They can also be frozen for up to two months.To make the compote, simmer the cranberries and sugar in a small pan for 4-5 mins until jammy, then leave to cool.For the icing, melt the chocolate, either in 20-30 secs bursts in a microwave or in a bowl over simmering water. Set aside to cool a little. Roughly mash the butter and icing sugar together, then beat until smooth with an electric whisk or mixer. Add the chocolate and cream cheese and beat again until smooth.To assemble the cake, place one sponge on a cake board the same size as the sponge, then sandwich the other sponges on top with a little icing and the cranberry compote. Use the cake with the neatest edge, flipped upside down, on top to give your cake a good shape.Pile about half the remaining icing on top of the cake and use a palette knife to spread it thinly over the top and down the sides of the cake. This is a crumb coat, it catches any crumbs, ensuring the final layer looks clean and professional. Chill the cake for 10-20 mins to firm up the icing or leave it somewhere cool for longer. Spread the remaining icing over the top and sides of the cakes, giving it nice sharp edges. We’ve left some of the cake exposed for the ‘naked’ cake look, or cover it completely if you like. Will keep for three days.To decorate the cake: dot the top with meringue kisses that you've either bought or made yourself, edible snowflake decorations and gold leaf, if you like.See our guide to decorating a Christmas cake 3 ways for details on this design along with more decorating ideas.See our guide to decorating a Christmas cake 3 ways for details on this design along with more decorating ideas.Use your gift card to cook our incredible Antipasti Pasta recipe!",

        "description": "Master the art of making sourdough bread with our step-by-step recipe. Learn how to create a starter, levain and the loaf itself with our expert tips.Day 1:To begin your starter, mix 50g flour with 50g tepid water in a jar or, better still, a plastic container. Make sure all the flour is incorporated and leave, semi-uncovered, at room temperature for 24 hrs.Day 2:Mix 50g flour with 50g tepid water and stir into yesterday’s mixture. Make sure all the flour is incorporated and leave, semi-uncovered, at room temperature for another 24 hrs.Day 3:Mix 50g flour with 50g tepid water and stir into yesterday’s mixture. Make sure all the flour is incorporated and leave, semi-uncovered, at room temperature for another 24 hrs.Day 4:You should start to see some activity in the mixture now; there should be some bubbles forming and bubbling on top. Mix 50g flour with 50g tepid water and stir into yesterday’s mixture. Make sure all the flour is incorporated and leave, semi-uncovered, at room temperature for another 24 hrs.Day 5:The mixture should be very active now and ready for making your levain. If it’s not bubbling, continue to feed it on a daily basis until it does. When it’s ready, it should smell like yogurt.You now have a starter, which is the base to the bread. You’ll need to look after it, but naming is optional! Keep it in the fridge (it will stay dormant) and 24 hrs before you want to use it, pour half of it off and feed it with 100g flour and 100g water. Leave it at room temperature and it should become active again. The longer the starter has been dormant, the more times it will need to be refreshed – the process of pouring off half the starter and replacing it with new flour and water – to reactivate. If your starter is ready to use, a teaspoonful of the mixture should float in warm water.For the levainMix 1 tbsp of the starter with 100g flour and 100g water (this is the same process as feeding the starter, but you should do this in a new, separate bowl, keeping the original starter as back-up, as this is the mixture you'll use to bake your bread). Leave the levain for 8 hrs at room temperature until it becomes active. When ready, a teaspoonful of the mixture should float in warm water.For the breadPour 600g tepid water into the levain and stir with a rubber spatula to mix together – don’t worry if there are unmixed bits of levain. Tip in the flour and mix everything together with a rubber spatula to make a rough dough, ensuring all the flour is incorporated evenly and that there are no dry bits up the side of the bowl. Cover and leave somewhere warm for at least 30 mins, or up to 4 hrs.Sprinkle over the salt and add 50g water to the dough. Pinch and scrunch the salt and water through the dough with your hands. If the dough goes stringy (like old chewing gum), just keep working it until it’s one smooth texture. Leave for another 15 mins.Wet your hands, grab the dough from one side and stretch it over itself, then repeat with the other side. This stretching technique helps develop the gluten. Pick the dough up and curl it around onto itself, then cover and leave for another 20-30 mins. Repeat this process two more times (three in total), then leave the dough for another 2-3 hrs until it’s risen by about 30% and looks bubbly and soft.Using a rubber spatula, scrape the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and split in two. Fold each piece onto itself to create a ball, then leave uncovered for 30 mins. The dough balls will spread during this time.Dust two bread-proving baskets generously with flour. Scrape one of the balls of dough off the work surface, then fold it onto itself to create a tight ball that’s trapped in all the air. Lift the ball into a basket, seam-side up, then transfer to the fridge to chill overnight, or for up to 18 hrs. Repeat with the other dough ball.Heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 9 and put a lidded casserole dish in the oven to heat. Cut a sheet of baking parchment into a square slightly larger than the base of one of the loaves. Carefully remove the hot casserole dish from the oven and remove the lid. Invert one loaf onto the baking parchment, then, working quickly, score the top at an angle. Use the corners of the parchment to lift the loaf into the casserole dish. Cover with the lid and bake for 30 mins, then carefully uncover and continue to bake for another 10 mins (or longer for a darker finish). Carefully lift the bread out of the dish using a spatula, transfer to a wire rack and leave to cool to room temperature before slicing. Repeat with the second loaf.Tear any stale sourdough into chunks, put on a baking tray, grate over some parmesan, drizzle with olive oil, toss well and bake at 200C/180C fan/gas 6 for 20-25 mins until golden.

Cover and leave somewhere warm for at least 30 mins, or up to 4 hrs.",

            "Wet your hands, grab the dough from one side and stretch it over itself, then repeat with the other side. This stretching technique helps develop the gluten. Pick the dough up and curl it around onto itself, then cover and leave for another 20-30 mins. Repeat this process two more times (three in total), then leave the dough for another 2-3 hrs until it’s risen by about 30% and looks bubbly and soft.",

Scrape one of the balls of dough off the work surface, then fold it onto itself to create a tight ball that’s trapped in all the air. Lift the ball into a basket, seam-side up, then transfer to the fridge to chill overnight, or for up to 18 hrs. Repeat with the other dough ball.",

Cut a sheet of baking parchment into a square slightly larger than the base of one of the loaves. Carefully remove the hot casserole dish from the oven and remove the lid. Invert one loaf onto the baking parchment, then, working quickly, score the top at an angle. Use the corners of the parchment to lift the loaf into the casserole dish. Cover with the lid and bake for 30 mins, then carefully uncover and continue to bake for another 10 mins (or longer for a darker finish).

The flavour of the jam will mature and intensify over the next few months, so tuck it away in a dark, cool place.To sterilise jars, wash thoroughly in hot soapy water, then dry in a low oven; or run them through the dishwasher. Pot the jam while the jars are still warm. Will keep up to a year.To test for setting point, put a saucer into the freezer well before you start boiling. Spoon a little of the jam onto the saucer.
